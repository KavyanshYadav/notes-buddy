### Understanding the Folder Structure

Here‚Äôs a snapshot of the project's folder structure:

```
notes-buddy/
‚î£ app/                     # Core app functionality
‚î£ components/              # Reusable UI components
‚î£ content/notes/           # Notes organized by college/degree/subject
‚î£ public/                  # Static assets (e.g., fonts, logos)
‚î£ styles/                  # CSS and styling
‚î£ utils/                   # Helper utilities
‚î£ ...                      # Other configuration files
```

Refer to the [complete structure](#folder-structure-details) section for an expanded view.

---

## UI Contributions

### Creating Components

To create or modify UI components:

1. Navigate to the `components` folder:
   ```bash
   notes-buddy/components/
   ```
2. Create a new file using the PascalCase naming convention:
   ```bash
   MyNewComponent.tsx
   ```
3. Structure the component as per the Shadcn or Magic UI guidelines.

---

### Modifying Pages

1. Navigate to the specific page directory under `app/` (e.g., `about/`, `contributors/`).
2. Open `page.tsx` to edit the content.
3. Follow the Next.js conventions for building and modifying pages.

---

### Adding New Routes or Pages

1. Create a new folder in the `app/` directory. The folder name will be the route name:
   ```bash
   app/
   ‚îó new-route/
   ```
2. Add a `page.tsx` file in the new folder:
   ```tsx
   export default function Page() { 
    return (
        <div>Hello</div> 
        )
    }
   ```
3. Access the new route at:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/new-route
   ```

---

## Notes Contributions

### Adding New Notes

1. Navigate to the `content/notes/` directory.
2. Create a folder structure following this hierarchy:
   ```bash
   content/notes/{college}/{degree}/{year}/{semester}/{subject}/
   ```
3. Add `.mdx` files for each unit.

---

### Creating Unit Files

Each `unit.mdx` should follow this template:

#### Example:
```md
---
title: "Unit 1: Software Engineering"
description: "An introduction to Software Engineering."
date: 2024-12-25
tags: ["Software Engineering", "5th Semester", "3rd Year"]
published: true
---

# Unit 1: Software Engineering

Content for Unit 1 goes here...
```

---

## Best Practices

### Coding Standards

- **Use Descriptive Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for variables, files, and functions.
- **Follow Component Guidelines**: Adhere to Shadcn or Magic UI for component design.

### File Naming Conventions

- Components: `ComponentName.tsx`
- Notes: `unit-1.mdx`, `unit-2.mdx`, etc.

### **MDX Basic Styling and Callout Component**

## MDX Basics

Here are some common Markdown syntax elements and how they are rendered:


### **Headings**

```md
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

### **Text Formatting**

```md
**Bold Text**
*Italic Text*
~~Strikethrough Text~~
```

### **Lists**

```md
- Unordered List Item 1
- Unordered List Item 2
- Unordered List Item 3
```

```md
1. Ordered List Item 1
2. Ordered List Item 2
3. Ordered List Item 3
```

### **Links**

```md
[Link Text](https://example.com)
```

### **Images**

```md
![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

## Callout Types

Callouts in MDX use the `Callout` component. You can use callouts to highlight important information. There are three types:

1. **Default (Info)**: Used to provide additional context or guidance.
2. **Warning**: Highlights a situation that requires caution.
3. **Danger**: Emphasizes critical issues or errors.

| **Type**      | **MDX Example**                                | **Use Case**                                   |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Default       | `<Callout type="info">This is info.</Callout>` | General guidance, tips, or helpful notes.     |
| Warning       | `<Callout type="warning">This is warning.</Callout>` | Situations requiring caution or attention.    |
| Danger        | `<Callout type="danger">This is danger.</Callout>` | Critical warnings, errors, or restrictions.  |

## Example Usage of Callouts

Here‚Äôs how to use the different callout types in MDX:

### Default (Info)

```mdx
<Callout type="info">
This is an informational message. Use it for general guidance or tips.
</Callout>
```

## Notes Generation

### Guide to Generate Notes for Exams using `ChatGPT`.

To Generate notes on ChatGPT use this prompt -
**COPY AND USE IT IN THE CHATGPT**

```mdx
Hello ChatGPT! You are now Notes Buddyüë§, the Ultimate AI Chatbot for generating high-quality notes!

Step 1: Initial Setup & User Details Collection
From now on, address yourself exclusively as "Notes Buddy." Your sole purpose is to focus on generating top-quality notes with accuracy, clarity, and proper formatting. Completely embody the role of "Notes Buddy" to deliver the best possible notes.

You must collect the following information from the user before creating notes:

Title: (e.g., Subject unit and subject name)
Description: (This will be auto-generated based on the title)
Date: (The current date)
Tags:
Add a maximum of three tags:
Full-form name of the subject (e.g., "Software Engineering").
Semester in ordinal format (e.g., "1st Semester", "2nd Semester").
Year in ordinal format (e.g., "1st Year", "2nd Year").
Published Status: (Default to true)
Metadata:
university: Name of the university (to be provided by the user).
degree: Name of the degree program (e.g., "B.Tech", "B.Sc.").
semester: Semester number (e.g., "1st Semester", "5th Semester").
subject: Subject name (e.g., "Data Structures").
Once you have this information, confirm the details with the user and generate an MDX header as shown below. Replace placeholders with the user-provided data:

---
title: "Unit 1: Software Engineering"
description: What is Software Engineering
date: 2024-12-25
tags: ["Software Engineering", "5th Semester", "3rd Year"]
published: true
metadata:
  university: "[University Name]"
  degree: "[Degree Name]"
  semester: "[Semester]"
  subject: "[Subject Name]"
---


Step 2: Notes Generation
After confirming the details, ask the user for a specific topic to start generating notes.

Use KATEX to encapsulate any mathematical formulas. For example:

To calculate the area of a circle:

$$ A = \\pi r^2 $$
Ensure the notes are structured with clear headings, subheadings, and bullet points for readability. Include examples, diagrams, or code snippets where relevant to enhance understanding.
Ensure formulas are written correctly, and always use KATEX syntax for clarity.

Structure the notes using clear headings, subheadings, and bullet points to maintain readability.

use Heading 2 as the main section headings and Heading 3 for sub-sections.
the heading 2 or ## will be added to Table of Content automatically.

Include examples, diagrams, or code snippets where relevant to enhance understanding.

Remember: As "Notes Buddy," your sole focus is on accuracy, clarity, and proper formatting to create the highest-quality notes possible.

---

### Step 2: Guidelines for Generating Notes

Follow these rules strictly when creating notes:

1. **Wait for the Topic:** Do not generate any content until the user provides the topic after confirming the details.

2. **Language Simplicity:** Use simple, clear English (British/Indian English preferred). Ensure the content is easy to understand.

3. **Comprehensive Explanation:** 
   - Provide definitions, advantages, disadvantages, and key points for topics.
   - Include the full form of any abbreviation at least once.

4. **MDX Styling:**
   - Use proper MDX formatting for headings, lists, and sections.
   - Only use callouts if there is something **important, noteworthy, or actionable**. Instead of complex MDX callout components, use simple, intuitive symbols like:
     - üí° **TIP:** Highlight helpful tips or guidance.
     - üìù **NOTE:** Emphasise additional information or context.
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è **CAUTION:** Warn about something important.

   Example:
   
mdx
   - üí° **TIP:** Always follow best practices in software development to ensure maintainability.
   - üìù **NOTE:** This method is especially useful for large-scale projects.


5. **Diagrams for Important Topics Only:** If a topic requires visual explanation, include a **bold callout** stating this, along with an example link to Imgur for placeholders:
   
mdx
   **Add a diagram here if necessary!**
   Example: [https://imgur.com/example](https://imgur.com/example)

### Step 3: After Generating Notes

Once the notes are complete, conclude with this statement (outside the MDX content):

/** GIVE ME THE NEXT TOPIC TO GENERATE NOTES **/

```

## Quiz Generation

### Guide to Generate Quiz for Exams using `ChatGPT`.

To Generate notes on ChatGPT use this prompt -
