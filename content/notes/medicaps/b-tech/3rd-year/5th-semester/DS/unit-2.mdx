## Sample Spaces in Data Science

### Definition:
In probability theory and statistics, a **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. It is a fundamental concept that helps in understanding events and their probabilities. For any experiment, the sample space contains all the potential results.

### Key Points:
- A **sample space** is denoted as $$ S $$.
- Each individual outcome within the sample space is called a **sample point**.
- The sample space can be **discrete** (finite number of outcomes) or **continuous** (an infinite number of outcomes).

### Types of Sample Spaces:
1. **Discrete Sample Space:**
   - Consists of a finite number of outcomes.
   - Example: Rolling a six-sided die. The sample space is $$ S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} $$.

2. **Continuous Sample Space:**
   - Contains an infinite number of outcomes within a range.
   - Example: Measuring the height of students in a class. The sample space could be any value between, say, 150 cm to 200 cm, represented as an interval $$ [150, 200] $$.

### Advantages:
- Helps in calculating probabilities.
- Essential for designing experiments and understanding statistical models.
- Forms the foundation for understanding more complex concepts in probability theory.

### Disadvantages:
- In continuous sample spaces, calculating exact probabilities may not always be practical.
- In complex experiments, defining the sample space can become challenging.

üìù **NOTE:** A sample space is usually represented in curly braces for discrete spaces and in intervals for continuous ones.

### Example of Sample Space:
Consider the experiment of flipping a coin:
- The sample space is $$ S = \{ \text{Heads}, \text{Tails} \} $$.

## Events, Conditional Probability, and Independence in Data Science

### 1. **Events:**
In probability theory, an **event** is a specific outcome or a set of outcomes from a random experiment. An event can be classified into several types, such as simple or compound, depending on the number of outcomes it contains.

#### Key Points:
- An **event** is denoted by a capital letter (e.g., $$ A, B, C $$).
- The **sample space** is the set of all possible events.
- Events can be **mutually exclusive**, meaning they cannot occur at the same time.

#### Types of Events:
- **Simple Event:** A single outcome from the sample space. Example: The event of getting a 3 when rolling a die is a simple event.
- **Compound Event:** An event consisting of two or more simple events. Example: The event of getting an odd number when rolling a die is a compound event.

üìù **NOTE:** Events can be combined using **union** or **intersection**:
- **Union**: The event that either of two events happens, denoted as $$ A \cup B $$.
- **Intersection**: The event that both events happen, denoted as $$ A \cap B $$.

---

### 2. **Conditional Probability:**
Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.

#### Definition:
The conditional probability of event $$ A $$ given event $$ B $$ is denoted as $$ P(A | B) $$ and is defined as:

$$ P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} $$

Where:
- $$ P(A \cap B) $$ is the probability of both events $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ occurring.
- $$ P(B) $$ is the probability of event $$ B $$ occurring.

#### Example:
If you have a deck of cards and you know that a drawn card is a face card, the probability of it being a King, given that it‚Äôs a face card, would be:

$$ P(\text{King} | \text{Face card}) = \frac{P(\text{King} \cap \text{Face card})}{P(\text{Face card})} $$

üí° **TIP:** Conditional probability is essential in scenarios such as Bayesian inference, where new information modifies the probability of an event.

---

### 3. **Independence:**
Two events are said to be **independent** if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event occurring.

#### Definition:
Two events $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ are independent if:

$$ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) $$

#### Key Points:
- If $$ P(A | B) = P(A) $$, then events $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ are independent.
- Independence means that knowing event $$ B $$ has occurred does not change the probability of event $$ A $$ occurring, and vice versa.

#### Example:
If you flip a coin and roll a die, the events ‚Äúgetting heads‚Äù and ‚Äúrolling a 4‚Äù are independent because the outcome of the coin flip does not influence the die roll.

‚ö†Ô∏è **CAUTION:** Be careful when interpreting independence. Some events may seem independent but are not, especially in the context of dependent or causal relationships.

## Random Variables, Discrete and Continuous Random Variables

### 1. **Random Variables:**
A **random variable** is a variable that takes on different values based on the outcome of a random experiment. These values are outcomes from a random process and are usually numerical.

#### Definition:
A random variable is typically denoted by a capital letter (e.g., $$ X, Y, Z $$) and is classified into two types: **discrete** and **continuous**.

#### Key Points:
- **Random Variables** are used to model uncertainty.
- The probability distribution of a random variable describes how the probabilities are assigned to each possible value it can take.

### 2. **Discrete Random Variables:**
A **discrete random variable** is a type of random variable that can take on only a finite or countably infinite number of values. These variables are usually associated with counting processes.

#### Definition:
A discrete random variable takes specific, distinct values, such as integers or specific categories.

#### Example:
- The number of heads in 10 flips of a coin.
- The number of customers arriving at a store in an hour.

The probability mass function (PMF) is used to describe the probability distribution of discrete random variables.

#### Probability Mass Function (PMF):
The PMF gives the probability that a discrete random variable takes a specific value. For a discrete random variable $$ X $$, the PMF is denoted as $$ P(X = x) $$.

#### Example:
If you roll a fair die, the probability of each outcome is:

$$ P(X = x) = \frac{1}{6} $$ for each $$ x \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} $$.

üí° **TIP:** Discrete random variables are easy to model and understand as they deal with distinct outcomes, making them suitable for simple counting experiments.

---

### 3. **Continuous Random Variables:**
A **continuous random variable** can take on an infinite number of values within a given range. These variables are typically associated with measurements.

#### Definition:
A continuous random variable has an infinite number of possible values within a certain interval. It can take any value on a continuum (e.g., real numbers between 0 and 1).

#### Example:
- The time it takes for a bus to arrive at a bus stop.
- The temperature at noon on a given day.

The probability density function (PDF) is used to describe the probability distribution of continuous random variables.

#### Probability Density Function (PDF):
For a continuous random variable $$ X $$, the PDF is denoted as $$ f(x) $$, and the probability that $$ X $$ takes a value within an interval $$ [a, b] $$ is given by:

$$ P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx $$

#### Example:
The probability distribution of the time taken for a bus to arrive could be modeled using a normal distribution, where the probability of the bus arriving at any specific minute is zero, but the probability of it arriving within a range of minutes is non-zero.

‚ö†Ô∏è **CAUTION:** In continuous random variables, the probability that the variable takes on any specific value is always zero. Instead, we calculate probabilities over an interval.

---

### Comparison between Discrete and Continuous Random Variables:

| **Property**                 | **Discrete Random Variables**           | **Continuous Random Variables**        |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Type of Values**            | Countable, distinct values             | Uncountably infinite, any value in an interval |
| **Probability Distribution**  | Probability Mass Function (PMF)        | Probability Density Function (PDF)    |
| **Example**                   | Number of students in a classroom      | Time taken for a task to complete     |

üìù **NOTE:** Discrete random variables are often used for counting occurrences, while continuous random variables are used when measurements are involved.

---

## Densities and Distributions: Normal Distribution and Its Properties

### 1. **Densities and Distributions:**
In probability theory, the **probability distribution** of a random variable provides the likelihood of each possible outcome. The **probability density function (PDF)** is used for continuous random variables, while the **probability mass function (PMF)** is used for discrete random variables.

#### Key Points:
- A **probability density function (PDF)** describes the relative likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a particular value.
- The total area under the PDF curve is always 1, representing 100% probability.
  
For a continuous random variable $$ X $$, the probability that it lies within an interval $$ [a, b] $$ is given by:

$$ P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx $$

Where $$ f(x) $$ is the PDF of $$ X $$.

---

### 2. **Normal Distribution:**
The **Normal distribution**, also known as the **Gaussian distribution**, is one of the most important and widely used probability distributions. It is a continuous probability distribution that describes a symmetric bell-shaped curve. It is used in a variety of fields, including data science, economics, and natural sciences.

#### Definition:
The Normal distribution is characterized by its **mean (Œº)** and **standard deviation (œÉ)**. It is often denoted as:

$$ X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) $$

Where:
- $$ \mu $$ is the **mean** or **expectation** (the central value of the distribution).
- $$ \sigma $$ is the **standard deviation** (a measure of the spread of the distribution).

#### Key Features:
- **Shape**: The curve is symmetric around the mean $$ \mu $$.
- **Bell-shaped**: Most of the data points lie close to the mean, with fewer points as you move further away from the mean.
- **Asymptotic**: The tails of the distribution extend infinitely, but the probability of extreme values is very low.

### 3. **Properties of Normal Distribution:**
- **Symmetry**: The normal distribution is symmetric about the mean, meaning that the left and right sides of the curve are mirror images of each other.
  
- **Mean, Median, and Mode**: For a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.

- **68-95-99.7 Rule** (Empirical Rule):
  - Approximately **68%** of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.
  - Approximately **95%** falls within two standard deviations.
  - Approximately **99.7%** falls within three standard deviations.

- **Skewness and Kurtosis**:
  - **Skewness**: A normal distribution has zero skewness, meaning it is perfectly symmetrical.
  - **Kurtosis**: The normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3, which indicates it has "normal" tails (not too heavy or light).

#### Probability Density Function (PDF) of Normal Distribution:
The PDF of a normal distribution is given by:

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} $$

Where:
- $$ e $$ is Euler‚Äôs number (approximately 2.718),
- $$ \mu $$ is the mean,
- $$ \sigma $$ is the standard deviation.

---

### 4. **Standard Normal Distribution:**
A special case of the normal distribution is the **standard normal distribution**, where the mean $$ \mu $$ is 0 and the standard deviation $$ \sigma $$ is 1. It is often denoted as:

$$ Z \sim N(0, 1) $$

#### Z-Score:
The **Z-score** is a measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. It is calculated using:

$$ Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} $$

Where:
- $$ X $$ is the value of the random variable,
- $$ \mu $$ is the mean,
- $$ \sigma $$ is the standard deviation.

üí° **TIP:** Z-scores allow us to standardize data and compare values from different normal distributions.

---

### 5. **Applications of Normal Distribution:**
The normal distribution is used in a wide variety of fields:
- **Finance**: Modelling stock returns, portfolio optimization.
- **Engineering**: Quality control and process management.
- **Social Sciences**: Behavioural studies, psychological testing.

#### Example:
- The heights of adult women in a population might follow a normal distribution, with a mean height of 160 cm and a standard deviation of 10 cm. The probability of selecting a woman who is taller than 170 cm can be calculated using the normal distribution formula.

---

### **Comparison of Normal Distribution with Other Distributions:**
| **Feature**                    | **Normal Distribution** | **Other Distributions** |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Shape**                       | Bell-shaped, symmetric  | Varies (e.g., skewed, bimodal) |
| **Mean, Median, Mode**          | All are the same        | May differ               |
| **Kurtosis**                    | 3                       | Varies (e.g., exponential has 1.2) |
| **Applications**                | Widely applicable       | Specialized (e.g., binomial, Poisson) |

‚ö†Ô∏è **CAUTION:** The normal distribution assumes that data is symmetrically distributed and that extreme values are rare. If your data is highly skewed or has outliers, other distributions (e.g., log-normal, t-distribution) may be more appropriate.

## **Introduction to Markov Chains and Random Walks**

### **Markov Chains: Definition**

A **Markov Chain** is a mathematical system that undergoes transitions from one state to another within a finite or countable number of possible states. It is a sequence of random variables where the outcome of each variable depends only on the state of the previous one, following the **Markov property**.

- **Markov Property:** This states that the future state depends only on the current state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. In simpler terms, "the past does not matter" when predicting the future state.

Formally, a Markov Chain is defined by the following components:
- **States**: The set of all possible outcomes or positions.
- **Transition Matrix**: A matrix that describes the probabilities of moving from one state to another.
- **Initial State**: The state at the beginning of the process.

#### **Example of a Markov Chain:**

Consider a weather system where the weather today depends only on the weather of the previous day. The states can be "Sunny" and "Rainy."

| From ‚Üí To | Sunny | Rainy |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Sunny** | 0.8   | 0.2   |
| **Rainy** | 0.4   | 0.6   |

- If the weather is sunny today, there is an 80% chance it will be sunny tomorrow and a 20% chance it will be rainy.
- If the weather is rainy today, there is a 40% chance it will be sunny tomorrow and a 60% chance it will be rainy.

### **Random Walks: Definition**

A **Random Walk** is a mathematical concept that describes a sequence of steps where each step is determined randomly, and it can be considered a special case of a Markov Chain. 

In a **one-dimensional random walk**, at each step, the position of an object (e.g., a particle) changes by a fixed amount in either direction (left or right). The direction of movement is determined randomly with equal probabilities.

#### **Key Points of Random Walks:**
- It can be viewed as a process where each step taken is random but based on certain probabilistic rules.
- In one dimension, the object moves left or right, with a 50% chance of either.

**Example:**
Imagine a person starts at position 0 and takes steps either left or right with equal probability at each step.

| Step 1 | Step 2 | Step 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Right  | Left   | Right  |

After three steps, the person would be at position 1 (0 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 0 ‚Üí 1).

### **Connection between Markov Chains and Random Walks**

Random walks can be viewed as a simple example of a Markov Chain. In a random walk, the state of the system at any time depends only on its current position, and the transition to the next position is based on a fixed probability. This is a direct application of the Markov property.

---

üí° **TIP:** Random walks are commonly used to model phenomena in various fields such as physics (particle movement), economics (stock market movements), and computer science (algorithm analysis).

---

## **Descriptive, Predictive, and Prescriptive Statistics**

### **Descriptive Statistics**

Descriptive statistics involves the **summarization and description** of a set of data. It provides simple summaries about the sample and the measures. Descriptive statistics help us to understand the basic features of the data in a study.

#### **Key Concepts:**
- **Measures of Central Tendency:**
  - **Mean:** The average of all data points.
  - **Median:** The middle value when the data is ordered.
  - **Mode:** The value that occurs most frequently in the data set.
  
- **Measures of Dispersion:**
  - **Range:** The difference between the highest and lowest values.
  - **Variance:** Measures how far each data point is from the mean.
  - **Standard Deviation:** The square root of the variance, providing a measure of spread.

#### **Example:**
Given the data set: [5, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 12]

- **Mean** = (5 + 7 + 8 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 12) / 7 = 8.14
- **Median** = 8 (middle value)
- **Mode** = 8 (occurs most frequently)
- **Range** = 12 - 5 = 7

---

### **Predictive Statistics**

Predictive statistics refers to using **historical data** to predict future outcomes. It involves using statistical models and machine learning algorithms to forecast trends and behaviors.

#### **Key Concepts:**
- **Regression Analysis:** This involves identifying the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
  - **Linear Regression:** A method for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables.
  - **Logistic Regression:** Used when the dependent variable is binary (e.g., yes/no).

- **Time Series Forecasting:** This involves analyzing data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals and using it to forecast future values.

#### **Example:**
If you want to predict the sales of a product next month based on past data, you would use regression analysis to create a model that estimates future sales based on past trends.

---

### **Prescriptive Statistics**

Prescriptive statistics goes beyond describing data or predicting future trends. It focuses on recommending actions to achieve desired outcomes, often using optimization and decision analysis techniques.

#### **Key Concepts:**
- **Optimization Models:** These models determine the best course of action by considering constraints and objectives.
  - **Linear Programming:** A mathematical method for determining a way to achieve the best outcome in a given mathematical model.
  
- **Decision Trees:** A model that helps to make decisions by breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable steps, which guide actions towards optimal solutions.

#### **Example:**
If a company uses prescriptive analytics, it may use optimization models to decide how much of each product to produce in order to maximize profit while minimizing cost.

---

### **Key Differences:**

| Type of Statistics        | Purpose                                      | Example Use Case                             |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Descriptive**            | Summarizes data                             | Summarizing sales data                      |
| **Predictive**             | Predicts future outcomes                    | Predicting stock prices                      |
| **Prescriptive**           | Recommends actions to achieve goals         | Optimizing delivery routes for a logistics company |

## **Statistical Inference, Populations, and Samples**

### **Statistical Inference**

Statistical inference refers to the process of drawing conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. It is a key aspect of statistics, as it allows researchers and analysts to make predictions or generalizations about larger groups without having to study every member of that group.

#### **Key Concepts in Statistical Inference:**
- **Estimation:** Involves estimating population parameters (like the population mean or standard deviation) based on sample statistics.
  - **Point Estimation:** A single value estimate for a population parameter (e.g., sample mean as an estimate for population mean).
  - **Interval Estimation:** A range of values used to estimate a population parameter, typically represented as a confidence interval.

- **Hypothesis Testing:** Involves testing assumptions (hypotheses) about a population parameter using sample data. Common tests include:
  - **t-tests** (for comparing means)
  - **chi-square tests** (for categorical data)
  - **ANOVA** (for comparing multiple group means)

#### **Example:**
Suppose you want to estimate the average height of all students in a university. Instead of measuring the height of every student (which may not be practical), you take a random sample of 100 students and calculate the sample mean. You can then use **confidence intervals** to make an inference about the population mean height.

---

### **Populations and Samples**

#### **Population:**
A population is the **entire group** of individuals or items that you are interested in studying. It includes all possible members or outcomes.

- **Example:** All the students in a university, all the cars in a city, or all the products manufactured in a factory.

#### **Sample:**
A sample is a **subset** of the population, selected to represent the entire population. It is often impractical or impossible to study the whole population, so a sample is chosen to make inferences about the population.

- **Example:** A group of 100 students selected randomly from a university to estimate the average height of all students in that university.

#### **Key Points:**
- The **population** includes everyone or everything you're studying.
- The **sample** is the smaller group drawn from the population for analysis.

---

### **Relationship Between Populations and Samples**

Statistical inference allows us to use sample data to make conclusions about a population. A good sample should be **random** and **representative** of the population to ensure the results are reliable and generalizable.

#### **Key Terms:**
- **Sampling Error:** The difference between the sample statistic (e.g., sample mean) and the actual population parameter (e.g., population mean). Sampling error is inevitable but can be minimized by increasing the sample size.
  
- **Bias:** If the sample is not representative of the population (e.g., it over-represents one group and under-represents another), the conclusions drawn from it can be biased.

---

### **Types of Sampling:**
1. **Simple Random Sampling:** Every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected.
2. **Stratified Sampling:** The population is divided into subgroups (strata), and a sample is drawn from each subgroup.
3. **Cluster Sampling:** The population is divided into clusters (often geographically), and entire clusters are randomly selected.
4. **Systematic Sampling:** A sample is selected at regular intervals from the population.

---

### **Example of Inference:**
Imagine you want to estimate the average weight of a certain species of fish in a lake. You catch a sample of 50 fish, measure their weights, and use the sample mean to estimate the average weight of the entire population of fish in the lake.

---

üí° **TIP:** A larger sample size generally leads to more reliable inferences, as it reduces the sampling error.

---

## **Statistical Modelling**

### **What is Statistical Modelling?**

Statistical modelling is the process of creating a mathematical model that represents the relationships between different variables in a dataset. It allows us to understand complex data, make predictions, and draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. The model consists of mathematical equations that describe how one variable (dependent variable) is influenced by one or more other variables (independent variables).

### **Key Elements of Statistical Models:**

1. **Dependent Variable (Response Variable):** The outcome or the variable we are trying to predict or explain.  
   - Example: Sales revenue, crop yield, student performance.

2. **Independent Variables (Predictors or Explanatory Variables):** The variables that influence the dependent variable.  
   - Example: Advertising budget, rainfall, study time.

3. **Error Term (Residuals):** The difference between the observed and predicted values. It represents the randomness or unexplained variability in the data.
   - Example: In predicting sales revenue, the error term might account for random fluctuations that cannot be explained by the model.

---

### **Types of Statistical Models:**

#### **1. Linear Models**

A **linear model** assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. The most common example is **linear regression**.

**Linear Regression Equation:**

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon $$

Where:
- \(Y\) is the dependent variable
- $$ X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n $$ are independent variables
- $$ \beta_0 $$ is the intercept (constant)
- $$ \beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_n $$ are coefficients representing the effect of each independent variable
- $$ \epsilon $$ is the error term

#### **Example:**
If you wanted to predict a person‚Äôs weight (dependent variable) based on their height and age (independent variables), you could create a linear regression model to estimate the relationship between these variables.

---

#### **2. Logistic Regression**

When the dependent variable is categorical (binary or multinomial), **logistic regression** is used instead of linear regression. It predicts the probability of a certain outcome.

**Logistic Regression Equation:**

$$ P(Y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \dots + \beta_n X_n)}} $$

Where:
- \(P(Y=1)\) is the probability that the dependent variable \(Y\) equals 1 (e.g., success)
- The other terms are similar to linear regression, but the model now predicts probabilities (values between 0 and 1).

#### **Example:**
If you are predicting whether a customer will buy a product (yes/no), logistic regression can be used to estimate the probability of a customer making a purchase based on factors such as age, income, and previous buying behavior.

---

#### **3. Time Series Models**

Time series models are used when the data is collected over time. They model the dependence of a variable on its past values.

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):** A popular method for time series forecasting. It models the relationship between past values and the forecasted values.

**ARIMA Model:**

$$ Y_t = \alpha + \beta Y_{t-1} + \gamma Y_{t-2} + \dots + \epsilon_t $$

Where:
- $$ Y_t $$ is the value of the variable at time \(t\)
- $$ \alpha $$ is a constant
- $$ \beta, \gamma $$ are coefficients
- $$ \epsilon_t $$ is the error term

#### **Example:**
If you wanted to forecast next month's sales based on the sales data of the past few months, you would use a time series model to identify trends and patterns over time.

---

### **Model Evaluation**

Once a statistical model is built, it must be evaluated to determine how well it fits the data. Common evaluation methods include:

- **R-squared (R¬≤):** Measures how well the independent variables explain the variation in the dependent variable. A value closer to 1 indicates a better fit.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** The average of the absolute errors between predicted and observed values.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** The square root of the average of squared errors, which penalizes larger errors more heavily.

---

### **Applications of Statistical Modelling**

- **Economics:** Predicting economic trends, inflation rates, or GDP growth.
- **Medicine:** Estimating the effectiveness of treatments or predicting disease outcomes.
- **Marketing:** Forecasting customer behavior, sales, or campaign success.
- **Engineering:** Analyzing quality control data and predicting system reliability.

---

üí° **TIP:** Always assess the assumptions behind your statistical model before drawing conclusions, as violating these assumptions can lead to misleading results.
