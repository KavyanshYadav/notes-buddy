## Limitations of Classical Mechanics

Classical mechanics, developed by Isaac Newton, describes the motion of macroscopic objects effectively. However, it fails to explain several phenomena observed at atomic and subatomic levels. 

### Key Limitations:
1. **Inapplicability to Microscopic Particles:**
   - Classical mechanics cannot describe the behaviour of particles at the atomic and subatomic scale (like electrons and protons).

2. **Failure in Explaining Black Body Radiation:**
   - Classical mechanics could not explain the spectrum of black body radiation, leading to the ultraviolet catastrophe, where infinite energy was predicted at short wavelengths.

3. **Photoelectric Effect:**
   - Classical theory predicted that light of any frequency would eject electrons from a metal if the intensity was high enough. However, experimental observations showed that electrons were only ejected if the light exceeded a threshold frequency, irrespective of intensity.

4. **Wave-Particle Duality:**
   - Classical mechanics treats matter and light purely as particles and waves respectively, failing to account for their dual behaviour.

5. **Stability of Atoms:**
   - According to classical electromagnetism, electrons orbiting a nucleus should continuously emit radiation and eventually collapse into the nucleus. However, atoms are stable in reality.

6. **Quantization of Energy Levels:**
   - Classical mechanics cannot explain the discrete energy levels observed in atomic spectra.

## De-Broglie Hypothesis for Matter Waves

### Introduction:
In 1924, **Louis de Broglie** proposed the **wave-particle duality** hypothesis, suggesting that particles of matter also exhibit wave-like properties. This was a revolutionary extension of quantum theory.

### De-Broglie Wavelength Formula:
The de-Broglie wavelength $$ \lambda $$ associated with a particle is given by:

$$ \lambda = \frac{h}{p} $$

where:  
- $$ \lambda $$ = Wavelength of the matter wave  
- $$ h $$ = Planck's constant $$ (6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js}) $$  
- $$ p $$ = Momentum of the particle = $$ mv $$ (mass √ó velocity)

### Derivation of De-Broglie Hypothesis:
De-Broglie derived his hypothesis by combining concepts from Planck's quantum theory and Einstein's theory of relativity.

1. **Energy of a photon:**  
   $$ E = h f $$  
   where $$ f $$ is the frequency of the wave.

2. **Relativistic Energy:**  
   $$ E = mc^2 $$  

3. **Equating both energies for a photon:**  
   $$ h f = mc^2 $$

4. **Since frequency is related to wavelength by $$ f = \frac{c}{\lambda} $$:**  
   $$ \lambda = \frac{h}{mc} $$  

5. **For a particle with momentum $$ p = mv $$:**  
   $$ \lambda = \frac{h}{p} $$  

### Significance of De-Broglie Hypothesis:
- **Wave-Particle Duality:** Suggests that every particle has both particle-like and wave-like characteristics.  
- **Experimental Verification:** Confirmed experimentally by **Davisson and Germer** through the electron diffraction experiment.  
- **Basis of Quantum Mechanics:** Led to the development of **Schr√∂dinger's wave equation**.

### Conditions for De-Broglie Wavelength to be Significant:
- More prominent for **small particles** like electrons.  
- Negligible for **macroscopic objects** due to large mass and small wavelength.

---

üí° **TIP:** The smaller the mass of the particle, the more significant the wave nature.  
üìù **NOTE:** De-Broglie's hypothesis forms the foundation of modern quantum mechanics and the concept of wave functions.

## Phase Velocity and Group Velocity

### Phase Velocity

**Phase velocity** refers to the speed at which a single wave crest (or phase) propagates through space. It describes how the phase of the wave moves over time.

### Formula:
The phase velocity $$v_p$$ is defined as:

$$ v_p = \frac{\omega}{k} $$

where:  
- $$v_p$$ = Phase velocity  
- $$\omega$$ = Angular frequency $$ (2\pi f) $$  
- $$k$$ = Wave number $$ (2\pi/\lambda) $$  
- $$f$$ = Frequency of the wave  
- $$\lambda$$ = Wavelength  

> üí° **TIP:** Phase velocity can sometimes exceed the speed of light but does not violate relativity as no physical information travels faster than light.

---

### Group Velocity

**Group velocity** refers to the speed at which the overall shape or envelope of a wave packet (a group of superimposed waves) propagates. It is associated with the transmission of energy or information.

### Formula:
The group velocity $$v_g$$ is defined as:

$$ v_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk} $$

where:  
- $$v_g$$ = Group velocity  
- $$\omega$$ = Angular frequency  
- $$k$$ = Wave number  

> üìù **NOTE:** Group velocity generally represents the speed of energy transfer and the actual motion of a particle in a wave packet.

---

### Relationship Between Phase and Group Velocity:

- In **non-dispersive** media:  
  $$ v_p = v_g $$ (both velocities are equal)  
- In **dispersive** media:  
  $$ v_p \neq v_g $$ and the velocities depend on the frequency.  

> üí° **TIP:** A dispersive medium is where different frequencies travel at different speeds, such as a prism splitting white light into colors.

---

### Physical Interpretation:
- **Phase Velocity:** Speed of a single crest in a continuous wave.  
- **Group Velocity:** Speed of the overall wave packet, often linked with the actual energy transfer.  

---

### Mathematical Relationship (for non-relativistic particles):
Using **De-Broglie's relation**, phase and group velocities can be related for a particle:

- Phase velocity:  
  $$v_p = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{E}{p}$$  

- Group velocity:  
  $$v_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk} = \frac{p}{m} = v$$  

where:  
- $$E$$ = Energy  
- $$p$$ = Momentum  
- $$v$$ = Particle's velocity  

> üìù **NOTE:** Group velocity often corresponds to the **actual speed** at which a particle or energy propagates in quantum mechanics.

---

## Wave Packet

A **wave packet** is a localized wave formed by the superposition of multiple waves with different wavelengths and frequencies. It describes a group of waves traveling together and is often used to represent particles in quantum mechanics.

---

### Definition:
A **wave packet** can be defined as a collection of waves of different frequencies and wavelengths that interfere constructively over a limited region of space, creating a localized pulse.

---

### Mathematical Representation:
A wave packet can be expressed as the superposition of harmonic waves:

$$ \Psi(x, t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} A(k) e^{i(kx - \omega t)} \,dk $$

where:  
- $$ \Psi(x, t) $$ = Wave function describing the wave packet  
- $$ A(k) $$ = Amplitude of the component wave  
- $$ k $$ = Wave number  
- $$ \omega $$ = Angular frequency  
- $$ x $$ and $$ t $$ = Position and time  

---

### Properties of a Wave Packet:
- **Localized Nature:** Confined to a small region in space.  
- **Combination of Waves:** Formed by combining multiple harmonic waves with varying frequencies and wavelengths.  
- **Group Velocity:** The speed at which the wave packet propagates.  
- **Phase Velocity:** The speed at which individual wave crests within the packet move.  

---

### Phase and Group Velocity in Wave Packets:
- **Phase Velocity:** Speed of individual wave crests.  
  $$v_p = \frac{\omega}{k}$$  

- **Group Velocity:** Speed of the entire wave packet, often linked to energy transmission.  
  $$v_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk}$$  

> üí° **TIP:** Group velocity typically represents the speed at which energy or information is transmitted, while phase velocity describes the motion of the individual wave peaks.

---

### Types of Wave Packets:
1. **Dispersive Wave Packet:**
   - Component waves have different velocities.  
   - Spreads over time due to varying phase velocities.  

2. **Non-Dispersive Wave Packet:**
   - All component waves travel at the same speed.  
   - The shape remains constant over time.  

---

### Wave Packet in Quantum Mechanics:
In quantum mechanics, a wave packet represents the **probability amplitude** of a particle's position and momentum. According to the **De-Broglie Hypothesis**, particles can be described by wave packets with the following properties:

- **Narrow Wave Packet:** Well-defined position but uncertain momentum.  
- **Broad Wave Packet:** Poorly-defined position but well-defined momentum.  

This is closely related to the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**:

$$ \Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} $$

where:  
- $$ \Delta x $$ = Uncertainty in position  
- $$ \Delta p $$ = Uncertainty in momentum  
- $$ \hbar $$ = Reduced Planck's constant  

---

### Physical Significance:
- **Classical Analogy:** A sound pulse traveling through air.  
- **Quantum Mechanics:** Describes particles as waves with uncertain position and momentum.  


> üìù **NOTE:** Wave packets help bridge the gap between classical and quantum mechanics by showing how particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.

---

## Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle

### Introduction:
**Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle** is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics proposed by **Werner Heisenberg** in 1927. It states that it is impossible to simultaneously determine both the exact position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision.

---

### Mathematical Statement:
The uncertainty principle is mathematically expressed as:

$$ \Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} $$

where:  
- $$ \Delta x $$ = Uncertainty in position  
- $$ \Delta p $$ = Uncertainty in momentum  
- $$ \hbar $$ = Reduced Planck's constant $$ \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js} $$

---

### Explanation:
- The product of uncertainties in position and momentum has a lower bound determined by Planck's constant.  
- If we try to measure the position ($$x$$) with high precision, the momentum ($$p$$) becomes highly uncertain, and vice versa.  

> üí° **TIP:** The uncertainty principle arises not due to imperfections in measurement but from the fundamental nature of quantum particles.

---

### Physical Interpretation:
- **Wave-Particle Duality:** Particles exhibit both wave and particle properties, making precise measurement challenging.  
- **Quantum Limitations:** The principle sets a fundamental limit on what can be known, not a technological limitation.  

---

### Derivation (Conceptual Outline):
1. **De-Broglie Wavelength:** $$ \lambda = \frac{h}{p} $$  
2. **Wave Nature of Particles:** A particle is described as a wave packet with a spread in $$k$$-values.  
3. **Fourier Transform Relations:** The spread in position and momentum space are inversely related.  

The result is the uncertainty relation:

$$ \Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} $$

---

### Consequences and Implications:
1. **Non-Deterministic Nature:**  
   - Quantum mechanics is inherently probabilistic, not deterministic like classical mechanics.  
2. **Zero Point Energy:**  
   - Even in the ground state, particles have non-zero energy due to uncertainty.  
3. **Electron Cloud in Atoms:**  
   - Electrons do not have definite orbits but exist in **probability clouds**.  
4. **Energy-Time Uncertainty:**  
   A related form of the principle:  
   $$ \Delta E \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} $$  
   - Describes uncertainty between energy and measurement time.  

---

### Experimental Evidence:
- **Electron Diffraction:** Confirmed the wave nature of particles and inherent uncertainty.  
- **Gamma Ray Microscope (Heisenberg Thought Experiment):** Demonstrates position and momentum limitations.  

> üìù **NOTE:** The uncertainty principle does not affect macroscopic objects due to their large mass, where uncertainties become negligible.

---

### Real-World Applications:
- **Quantum Tunneling:** Particles can pass through energy barriers due to uncertain position.  
- **Spectroscopy:** Line broadening is influenced by uncertainty in energy and time.  
- **Microscopy Limits:** Optical resolution limited by wavelength and uncertainty.  

---

### Conclusion:
- Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics.  
- It reveals the fundamental limitations on measurement, emphasizing the probabilistic nature of the microscopic world.

## Compton Scattering

### Introduction:
**Compton Scattering** is a quantum phenomenon where an X-ray or gamma photon collides with a free or loosely bound electron, resulting in a decrease in the photon's energy and an increase in its wavelength. This phenomenon provides evidence for the **particle nature of light**.

### Discovery:
- Discovered by **Arthur H. Compton** in **1923**.  
- Experimentally confirmed the **dual nature of light** and the existence of **photons** as discrete energy packets.  

---

### Explanation:
During the scattering process:  
1. A **high-energy photon** (X-ray or gamma-ray) collides with an electron.  
2. The photon transfers part of its energy to the electron, which is ejected.  
3. The scattered photon has **reduced energy** and a **longer wavelength** than the incident photon.

---

### Mathematical Derivation:
The change in the photon's wavelength after scattering is called the **Compton shift** and is given by:

$$ \Delta \lambda = \lambda' - \lambda = \frac{h}{m_e c} (1 - \cos \theta) $$

where:  
- $$ \Delta \lambda $$ = Change in wavelength (Compton shift)  
- $$ \lambda' $$ = Scattered photon wavelength  
- $$ \lambda $$ = Incident photon wavelength  
- $$ h $$ = Planck's constant $$ (6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js}) $$  
- $$ m_e $$ = Electron rest mass $$ (9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}) $$  
- $$ c $$ = Speed of light $$ (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) $$  
- $$ \theta $$ = Scattering angle of the photon  

The term $$ \frac{h}{m_e c} $$ is called the **Compton wavelength** of the electron:

$$ \lambda_c = \frac{h}{m_e c} \approx 2.43 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{m} $$

---

### Energy Considerations:
- **Initial Photon Energy:** $$ E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} $$  
- **Final Photon Energy:** $$ E' = \frac{hc}{\lambda'} $$  
- **Kinetic Energy of the Electron:** $$ K = E - E' $$  

> üí° **TIP:** The greater the scattering angle $$ \theta $$, the larger the shift in wavelength and energy transfer to the electron.

---

### Key Observations:
1. **Wavelength Shift:**  
   - The shift in wavelength depends only on the angle $$ \theta $$.  
2. **Particle Nature of Light:**  
   - Confirms that photons behave as particles with quantized energy and momentum.  
3. **Conservation Laws:**  
   - **Energy** and **momentum** are conserved during the scattering process.  

---

### Experimental Verification:
**Compton's Experiment (1923)**:  
- X-rays were scattered from a graphite target.  
- A longer wavelength was observed for the scattered X-rays, confirming the theoretical predictions.  

---

### Significance and Applications:
- **Evidence for Photons:** Proved the particle nature of electromagnetic radiation.  
- **Quantum Mechanics Foundation:** Validated the concept of **wave-particle duality**.  
- **Medical Imaging:** Basis for **Compton scattering** used in **X-ray scattering** techniques.  
- **Astrophysics:** Used to study **high-energy cosmic rays**.  

> üìù **NOTE:** Compton scattering plays a crucial role in the interaction of radiation with matter and is widely applied in both physics research and medical diagnostics.

---

### Conclusion:
- **Compton Scattering** provides key evidence for the quantum theory of light.  
- It illustrates the interaction between **photons** and **matter**, emphasizing the particle-like behaviour of light.

## Wave Function

### Introduction:
The **wave function** is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that describes the quantum state of a particle or system. It provides information about the **probability amplitude** of a particle's position, momentum, and other physical properties.

---

### Definition:
The wave function is typically represented by the symbol **$$ \Psi(x, t) $$** and is a complex-valued function of position $$x$$ and time $$t$$.

### Mathematical Representation:
The wave function in one dimension can be expressed as:

$$ \Psi(x, t) = A e^{i(kx - \omega t)} $$

where:  
- $$ \Psi(x, t) $$ = Wave function  
- $$ A $$ = Amplitude of the wave  
- $$ k $$ = Wave number  
- $$ \omega $$ = Angular frequency  
- $$ x $$ = Position  
- $$ t $$ = Time  

---

### Physical Interpretation:
The **square of the wave function's magnitude** represents the probability density of finding a particle at a particular position and time:

$$ |\Psi(x, t)|^2 = \Psi^*(x, t) \Psi(x, t) $$

where:  
- $$ |\Psi(x, t)|^2 $$ = Probability density  
- $$ \Psi^*(x, t) $$ = Complex conjugate of the wave function  

> üìù **NOTE:** The wave function itself does not represent a physical quantity but helps calculate probabilities.

---

### Conditions for a Valid Wave Function:
A wave function must satisfy the following conditions to be physically meaningful:  

1. **Normalization Condition:**
   - The total probability must be **1**:  
     $$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\Psi(x, t)|^2 \, dx = 1 $$
   
2. **Single-Valued:**
   - The wave function must have a single value at every point.  

3. **Continuous and Differentiable:**
   - The wave function and its derivative should be continuous and differentiable to ensure valid physical predictions.  

4. **Finite:**
   - The wave function must be finite across all space.  

---

### Types of Wave Functions:
1. **Stationary Wave Function:**  
   - Time-independent, often for bound states.  
   - $$ \Psi(x) $$ depends only on position.  

2. **Time-Dependent Wave Function:**  
   - Includes both position and time variations.  

---

### Schr√∂dinger's Wave Equation:
The wave function satisfies the **Schr√∂dinger equation**, which governs the behavior of quantum particles:

**Time-Dependent Schr√∂dinger Equation:**

$$ i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + V(x)\Psi $$

where:  
- $$ \hbar $$ = Reduced Planck's constant  
- $$ m $$ = Mass of the particle  
- $$ V(x) $$ = Potential energy  

**Time-Independent Schr√∂dinger Equation:**

$$ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2 \Psi}{dx^2} + V(x)\Psi = E\Psi $$

---

### Probability Interpretation:
- The wave function describes a **probability distribution**.  
- The probability of finding a particle between $$x$$ and $$x + dx$$ is given by:  

$$ P(x) = |\Psi(x)|^2 dx $$

---

### Normalization Example:
If a wave function is $$ \Psi(x) = A e^{-x^2} $$, the normalization constant can be found using:

$$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |A e^{-x^2}|^2 \, dx = 1 $$

> üí° **TIP:** Proper normalization ensures the total probability equals 1.

---

### Physical Significance of the Wave Function:
- **Describes Quantum States:** Represents all information about a quantum system.  
- **Non-Deterministic Nature:** Predicts **probability** instead of definite outcomes.  
- **Superposition Principle:** Multiple wave functions can add together to form new valid states.  

---

### Key Concepts:
- **Collapse of the Wave Function:** Upon measurement, the wave function collapses to a definite state.  
- **Born Interpretation:** The square of the wave function gives the **probability density**.  
- **Quantum Tunneling:** The wave function can penetrate through energy barriers.  

> üìù **NOTE:** The wave function is fundamental in quantum mechanics and forms the basis for predicting outcomes in the microscopic world.

---

### Conclusion:
- The wave function is central to **quantum mechanics** and describes the probabilistic nature of particles.  
- It provides a complete description of a quantum system and is governed by the **Schr√∂dinger equation**.

---

## Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Time-Dependent and Time-Independent Wave Equation

### Introduction:
The **Schr√∂dinger wave equation** is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics formulated by **Erwin Schr√∂dinger** in 1926. It describes how the quantum state (wave function) of a particle evolves over time and space.

---

### 1. Time-Dependent Schr√∂dinger Equation (TDSE)

The **time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation (TDSE)** describes the behavior of a quantum particle where both time and space variations are considered. It governs the **dynamics** of a quantum system.

### Mathematical Form:

$$ i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi(x, t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi(x, t)}{\partial x^2} + V(x) \Psi(x, t) $$

where:  
- $$ \Psi(x, t) $$ = Wave function (depends on position and time)  
- $$ \hbar $$ = Reduced Planck's constant $$ (\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}) $$  
- $$ m $$ = Mass of the particle  
- $$ V(x) $$ = Potential energy  
- $$ i $$ = Imaginary unit  

---

### Key Concepts:
- **Quantum Evolution:** Describes how the quantum state evolves over time.  
- **Wave Function:** The solution $$ \Psi(x, t) $$ provides complete information about the quantum system.  
- **Probabilistic Nature:** The square of the wave function gives the probability density.  

---

### Physical Significance:
- Governs **dynamic behavior** of particles in quantum mechanics.  
- Used for studying **quantum dynamics**, such as tunneling and interference patterns.  

---

### General Solution (for a free particle):

$$ \Psi(x, t) = A e^{i(kx - \omega t)} $$

where:  
- $$ k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} $$ (Wave number)  
- $$ \omega = \frac{E}{\hbar} $$ (Angular frequency)  

---


### 2. Time-Independent Schr√∂dinger Equation (TISE)

The **time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation (TISE)** is derived from the TDSE when the potential energy $$V(x)$$ is time-independent. It describes **stationary states** where the probability distribution does not change with time.

### Mathematical Form:

$$ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2 \Psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x) \Psi(x) = E\Psi(x) $$

where:  
- $$ E $$ = Total energy of the particle (a constant for stationary states)  
- $$ \Psi(x) $$ = Wave function dependent only on position  
- The equation describes the particle's **spatial behavior** in a static potential.  

---

### Key Concepts:
- **Stationary States:** Describes systems where the probability distribution remains constant over time.  
- **Eigenvalue Problem:** The solutions give **quantized energy levels**.  
- **Eigenfunctions:** The wave functions $$ \Psi(x) $$.  

---

### Separation of Variables (Derivation from TDSE):
Starting with the TDSE:

$$ i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi(x, t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi(x, t)}{\partial x^2} + V(x) \Psi(x, t) $$

Assume the wave function can be separated into space and time components:

$$ \Psi(x, t) = \psi(x)\phi(t) $$

Plugging into TDSE and simplifying gives:

- Time component:  
  $$ i\hbar \frac{d\phi}{dt} = E\phi $$  

- Spatial component (TISE):  
  $$ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2 \psi}{dx^2} + V(x)\psi = E\psi $$  

---

### Physical Significance:
- **Energy Quantization:** Solving the TISE provides discrete energy levels for bound systems (like electrons in an atom).  
- **Stationary States:** Particles in stationary states do not evolve in time except for a phase factor.  

---

## Particle in a Box Problem

### Introduction:
The **Particle in a Box** is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics used to illustrate the principles of quantization and wave functions. It describes a particle that is free to move in a region of space (a "box") but is confined by infinitely high potential walls outside this region.

---

### Assumptions:
1. The particle is confined to a **one-dimensional box** with perfectly rigid walls.  
2. The potential energy $$ V(x) $$ inside the box is zero ($$ V(x) = 0 $$ for $$ 0 \leq x \leq L $$).  
3. The potential energy outside the box is infinite ($$ V(x) = \infty $$ for $$ x < 0 $$ or $$ x > L $$).  
4. The particle cannot escape the box due to the infinite potential outside.  

---

### Schr√∂dinger Equation:
The **time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation** for the particle inside the box is:

$$ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2 \Psi(x)}{dx^2} = E \Psi(x) $$

where:  
- $$ \hbar $$ = Reduced Planck's constant  
- $$ m $$ = Mass of the particle  
- $$ E $$ = Energy of the particle  
- $$ \Psi(x) $$ = Wave function  

---

### Boundary Conditions:
1. $$ \Psi(0) = 0 $$ (The wave function must vanish at $$ x = 0 $$).  
2. $$ \Psi(L) = 0 $$ (The wave function must vanish at $$ x = L $$).  

These conditions arise because the particle cannot exist outside the box, where the potential is infinite.

---

### Solution:
The general solution for the wave function inside the box is:

$$ \Psi(x) = A \sin(kx) + B \cos(kx) $$

Applying the boundary conditions:
1. At $$ x = 0 $$: $$ \Psi(0) = B = 0 $$.  
   Thus, $$ \Psi(x) = A \sin(kx) $$.  
2. At $$ x = L $$: $$ \Psi(L) = A \sin(kL) = 0 $$.  

For $$ A \neq 0 $$, $$ \sin(kL) = 0 $$, which gives:

$$ kL = n\pi \quad (n = 1, 2, 3, \dots) $$

Thus, $$ k $$ is quantized as:

$$ k = \frac{n\pi}{L} $$

---

### Quantized Energy Levels:
The energy $$ E $$ of the particle is related to $$ k $$ by:

$$ E = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} $$

Substituting $$ k = \frac{n\pi}{L} $$:

$$ E_n = \frac{n^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \quad (n = 1, 2, 3, \dots) $$

where $$ n $$ is the **quantum number** that determines the energy level.

---

### Wave Function:
The normalized wave function for the particle is:

$$ \Psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) $$

where $$ n = 1, 2, 3, \dots $$.

---

### Key Features:
1. **Quantization:** The energy of the particle is quantized, meaning it can only take discrete values $$ E_n $$.  
2. **Wave Function Nodes:** For the $$ n $$-th state, there are $$ n - 1 $$ nodes (points where $$ \Psi(x) = 0 $$ inside the box).  
3. **Ground State:** The lowest energy level ($$ n = 1 $$) is:  
   $$ E_1 = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} $$
4. **Higher Energy States:** Higher quantum numbers correspond to higher energy levels and more complex wave functions.

---

### Probability Density:
The probability density is given by:

$$ |\Psi_n(x)|^2 = \frac{2}{L} \sin^2\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) $$

- The probability of finding the particle is highest where the wave function has peaks.  
- The particle is least likely to be found at the nodes ($$ |\Psi(x)|^2 = 0 $$).

---

### Applications:
1. **Quantum Confinement:** Understanding electrons in nanostructures like quantum dots.  
2. **Spectroscopy:** Explains discrete energy levels in atoms and molecules.  
3. **Foundation of Quantum Mechanics:** Demonstrates the principles of quantization and wave behavior.

> üìù **NOTE:** The particle in a box model is an idealized system, but it effectively illustrates fundamental quantum mechanics principles.

---

### Conclusion:
The **Particle in a Box** problem is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics that demonstrates how confinement leads to quantized energy levels and wave functions. It provides critical insights into the behaviour of particles in quantum systems.
