### Geostationary Satellite Services

A geostationary satellite is an earth-orbiting satellite, placed at an altitude of approximately 35,786 kilometers (22,236 miles) directly over the equator, that revolves in the same direction the earth rotates (west to east). At this altitude, one orbit takes 23h 56m 4s (orbital period), the same length of time as the earth requires to rotate once on its axis. The term "geostationary" comes from the fact that such a satellite appears nearly stationary in the sky as seen by a ground-based observer. Three such satellites, each separated by 120 degrees of longitude, can provide coverage of the entire planet.

#### Applications

- Global communication, such as TV and radio transmission, and data transmission due to large coverage.

#### Advantages

- No need for tracking.
- Maximum lifetime of 15 years or more.
- 24-hour view of a particular area.
- High-speed switching because the number of repeaters is three.

#### Limitations

1. It is centered above the equator, so it cannot cover the Polar Regions.
2. The distance that an electromagnetic (EM) signal must travel to and from a geostationary satellite is a minimum of 71,572 kilometers. This introduces a latency of at least 240 milliseconds when an EM signal, traveling at 300,000 kilometers per second (186,000 miles per second), makes a round trip from the surface to the satellite and back.

### INSAT System

The Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) is a series of multipurpose geostationary satellites launched by ISRO to support telecommunications, broadcasting, meteorology, and search-and-rescue operations. Commissioned in 1983, INSAT is the largest domestic communication system in the Asia-Pacific Region. It is a joint venture of the Department of Space, Department of Telecommunications, India Meteorological Department, All India Radio, and Doordarshan. INSAT satellites provide transponders in various bands (C, S, Extended C, and Ku) to serve the television and communication needs of India. Some satellites also include Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) and CCD cameras for meteorological imaging, along with transponders for receiving distress alert signals for search and rescue missions in the South Asian and Indian Ocean regions.

#### INSAT System History

The INSAT system was commissioned with the launch of INSAT-1B in August 1983. (INSAT-1A, the first satellite launched in April 1982, could not fulfill its mission.) INSAT ushered in a revolution in India’s television and radio broadcasting, telecommunications, and meteorological sectors. It facilitated the rapid expansion of TV and telecommunication facilities to remote areas and offshore islands. Currently, INSAT is the largest domestic communication satellite system in the Asia-Pacific region, comprising satellites such as INSAT-2E, INSAT-3A, INSAT-3B, INSAT-3C, INSAT-3E, KALPANA-1, GSAT-2, EDUSAT, INSAT-4A, and INSAT-4B, providing 199 transponders in C, Extended C, and Ku bands. The system supports meteorological services, with KALPANA-1 being an exclusive meteorological satellite. INSAT satellites are monitored and controlled by Master Control Facilities at Hassan and Bhopal.

# Ocean Development

Oceans are known to be our last frontiers. The oceans cover about two-thirds of the planet earth and are the storehouse of food, minerals including oil and gas, energy, etc. For India, oceanography is relatively a young science. A systematic study of the Indian Ocean started with India's participation in the **International Indian Ocean Expedition (1960-65)**. Earlier to this, interest was shown only on a few aspects of the ocean science by some institutions and universities.

## Creation of a New Department

The Government of India, with the above aspects in view, created a new **Department of Ocean Development (DOD)** on **24th July 1981**, directly under the Prime Minister.

## Role and Activities (Objectives)

The Department intends to focus its attention on the following seven areas of activity under different groups:

1. Living resources  
2. Non-living resources  
3. Ship management  
4. Manpower planning  
5. International collaboration and Antarctic programmes  
6. Data collection and dissemination  
7. Legal regime  

### The Activities and Responsibilities of Each Area:

#### (i) Living Resources

Today in India, fisheries form the most important activity, and the expansion in the future would involve:  
- (a) Deep sea fishing  
- (b) Aquaculture  
- (c) Development of seaweed resources  

The Department will establish its link with all organizations and agencies involved in the exploration and exploitation of marine living resources. It will also provide necessary guidelines so that the Department can act as a catalytic agent and as a coordinating agency to provide the best results in the exploitation of living resources.

#### (ii) Non-Living Resources

This Division will plan and execute:  
- (a) Deep sea mining programmes of polymetallic nodules  
- (b) Exploration and exploitation of placer deposits along the coastal areas  
- (c) Extraction of renewable sources of energy from thermal differences in the water column, waves, tides, salinity difference, biomass conversion, etc.

#### (iii) Ship Management

The arrival of new ships will create a heavy demand for manpower, facilities, infrastructure, and services available in the country. Considerable work is required to finalize the cruises and their implementation with effective utilization of manpower from different user organizations in the country. This Division will coordinate with the organizations or agencies and also with the shipyards which will handle repair, maintenance, and dry-docking. These are impossible without the creation of a division of ships.

#### (iv) Manpower Planning

The most crucial factor in the entire developmental work of the marine sector is the availability of trained manpower. The department had made a rough assessment of the existing manpower to go on board the ship and collected the required data and information from ship-board.  

It is clear from such a study that trained manpower will have to be substantially increased. This has to be done through the universities, IITs, and other educational institutions. Fieldwork training on shipboard will have to be organized by such institutions which have research vessels (e.g., **NIO**, **GSI**, **ONGC**), and the work will be coordinated by **DOD**.

# Biotechnology

“Biotechnology is technology that utilizes biological systems, living organisms, or parts of this to develop or create different products. Brewing and baking bread are examples of processes that fall within the concept of biotechnology (use of yeast (= living organism) to produce the desired product).”

## Formulation of the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India

The remarkable march of India into the world of biosciences and technological advances began in **1986**. That year, the Prime Minister of the country, late **Rajiv Gandhi**, accepted the vision that unless India created a separate Department for Biotechnology within the Ministry of Science and Technology, the country would not progress to the desired extent.

That decision made India one of the first countries to have a separate department for this stream of science and technology. A separate **Department of Biotechnology (DBT)** was finally set up in **February 1986**, and the **NBTB** selected **Dr. S Ramachandran** as the first Secretary of the department.

Biotechnology techniques are widely used in medicine for diagnosing and treating different diseases. It provides opportunities to protect individuals from dangerous diseases. Techniques like **gene therapy**, **recombinant DNA technology**, and **polymerase chain reaction** (PCR) use genes and DNA molecules to diagnose diseases and replace damaged cells with healthy ones.

#### Key Applications in Medicine:

- **Biopharmaceuticals**:  
  Drugs are developed using microorganisms without synthetic materials or chemicals. These drugs, often derived from proteins, target and destroy hidden mechanisms of diseases without side effects. Scientists are working on biopharmaceutical drugs for diseases like hepatitis, cancer, and heart diseases.

- **Gene Therapy**:  
  Used for diagnosing and treating diseases like cancer and Parkinson’s. Healthy genes are inserted into the body to replace or repair damaged cells. In some cases, these genes correct genetic information, helping the body function properly.

- **Pharmaco-genomics**:  
  This method combines pharmaceuticals and genomics to analyze how an individual's body responds to certain drugs. The goal is to develop personalized medicines based on genetic information.

- **Genetic Testing**:  
  This technique identifies genetic diseases in parents, determines sex, and performs carrier screening. **DNA probes** with sequences similar to mutated ones are used. It also aids in criminal identification and parenthood testing.

---

### 2) Applications in Agriculture

Biotechnology has transformed agriculture by altering genes, cloning crops, and improving food quality, ultimately enhancing our lives.

#### Key Applications in Agriculture:

- **Vaccines**:  
  Oral vaccines are being developed by engineering antigenic proteins into **Genetically Modified (GM)** crops. These crops trigger an immune response, providing cost-effective solutions for combating diseases in developing countries.

- **Antibiotics**:  
  Plants are engineered to produce antibiotics for humans and animals. For example, feed containing antibiotic proteins is directly given to animals, reducing production costs. However, this raises ethical concerns about the overuse of antibiotics and the risk of resistant bacteria.

- **Flowers**:  
  Agricultural biotechnology is also used for aesthetic purposes, like improving the **color, smell, size**, and other features of flowers using gene recognition and transfer techniques.

- **Plant and Animal Reproduction**:  
  Traditional methods like cross-pollination and grafting are time-consuming. Biotechnology enables rapid, targeted changes at the molecular level by over-expressing, removing, or introducing genes. Tools like **gene promoters** and **transcription factors** enhance precision.

- **Pesticide-Resistant Crops**:  
  These crops tolerate pesticides, allowing farmers to eliminate weeds without harming the main crop. This technique should not be confused with pest-resistance.

---

## 3) Applications of Biotechnology in Food Processing  

- **Food Processing**:  
  Food processing converts non-palatable and perishable raw materials into edible and potable foods and beverages with longer shelf lives.  
  - **Fermentation**: The use of microbial organisms and their derivatives to increase edibility and shelf life.  
    - Fermented foods make up about one-third of the global diet, but improper fermentation methods, especially in rural areas, can cause food contamination, adversely affecting health.  
    - Fermentation is also used to prepare microbial cultures, food additives, and preservatives.  

- **Biotechnology in Food**:  
  - Improves the edibility, texture, and storage of food.  
  - Prevents viral attacks on food, especially dairy products (e.g., bacteriophages).  
  - Produces antimicrobial effects to eliminate harmful microorganisms and toxins (e.g., mycotoxins).  
  - Degrades toxins and anti-nutritional elements naturally present in food.  

- **Protein Engineering in Food**:  
  - Biotechnology enables the large-scale commercial production of favorable enzymes responsible for improved fermentation by culturing microorganisms.  

- **Fermented Foods**:  
  - Known for better flavor, texture, and nutritional value.  
  - High nutritional content has driven the development of high-yielding strains for superior quality products.  
  - Most fermented foods are produced through **solid-state fermentation**.  
  - Examples: **Cheese, idli, dosa, buttermilk**, etc.  

---

## 4) Applications of Biotechnology in Biofuels  

In recent years, the development of alternative, non-petroleum-based transportation fuels has gained momentum. Biotechnology plays a crucial role in enhancing biofuel production through advanced strategies:  
- Creation of **engineered or synthetic microorganisms** for producing ethanol, biodiesel, or other fuels.  
- Use of advanced biotechnological processes to improve biofuel quality and production efficiency.  

---

## Types of Biotechnology

### Overview:
- **Thorium** is not fissile and cannot directly undergo fission for energy production. It must first be transmuted into **Uranium-233**, a fissile material.  

### **Stage I: Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR)**  
- Natural uranium is used as fuel to produce electricity in PHWRs.  
- The process generates **Plutonium-239** as a by-product:  
  `Uranium-238 → Plutonium-239 + Heat`.  

---

### **Stage II: Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR)**  
- FBRs utilize **Plutonium-239**, recovered by reprocessing spent fuel from Stage I reactors, along with natural uranium.  
- **How it works**:
  - **Plutonium-239** undergoes fission to produce energy.  
  - **Uranium-238** in the fuel is transmuted to additional **Plutonium-239**.  
- FBRs are designed to "breed" more fuel than they consume.  
- Thorium is introduced as a blanket material, allowing it to transmute into **Uranium-233**, which is then used in the third stage.  

---

### **Stage III: Thorium-Based Reactors**  
- The main goal is to establish a **sustainable nuclear fuel cycle**.  
- Stage III reactors are fueled by **Thorium-232** and **Uranium-233**, creating a self-sustaining thermal breeder reactor system.  
- After the initial fuel charge, these reactors can be refueled using naturally occurring thorium.  

Due to the long delay before direct thorium utilization in the three-stage program, India is exploring advanced reactor designs that allow **parallel utilization** of thorium alongside the sequential program.
