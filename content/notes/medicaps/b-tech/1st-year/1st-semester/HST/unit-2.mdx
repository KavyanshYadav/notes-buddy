# Science and Technology Education

The history of education began with the teaching of traditional elements such as Indian religions, Indian mathematics, and Indian logic at early Hindu and Buddhist centers of learning, such as ancient Takshashila (in modern-day Pakistan) and Nalanda (in India). During British rule, science and technology development in India received inadequate support, as the focus was more on arts and humanities. The barriers to science education included:

- Exclusion of some science-related subjects from the government curriculum in the 1850s.
- Private institutions were unable to afford the establishment of scientific labs due to funding constraints.
- High fees for scientific education discouraged many, prompting those with resources to pursue foreign education.

## Milestones in Science and Technology Education

- **1825:** Technical schools existed in Calcutta and Bombay.
- **1847:** The first engineering college was established at Roorkee for training in civil engineering, marking it as the first engineering college in the British Empire.
- **1857:** Universities of Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras were modeled after London University.
- **1916:** Banaras Hindu University (formerly Central Hindu College) was established in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, by Madan Mohan Malaviya with cooperation from Annie Besant. It introduced degree courses in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering and is the largest residential university in Asia.
- **1945:** The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) was formed under the Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), to coordinate and develop technical and management education.
- **1951:** The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was inaugurated in Kharagpur, West Bengal, to promote technical education. More IITs were established in Bombay, Madras, Kanpur, and Delhi between 1951 and 1960.
- **1953:** Science became a compulsory independent subject in school curriculums. Education provided by the government was made free and compulsory up to the age of 14.
- **1985:** The Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), formerly the Ministry of Education, was founded. It oversees:
  1. **Department of School Education & Literacy:** Development of school education and literacy.
  2. **Department of Higher Education:** Growth in higher education, including the establishment of the University Grants Commission (UGC) in 1956.

## Challenges in Science and Technology Development

According to former Indian science and technology minister Kapil Sibal, India is lagging behind developed countries in science and technology. For instance:

- India has only 140 researchers per 1,000,000 population compared to 4,651 in the United States.
- Investment in science and technology in 2002â€“2003 was $3.7 billion, while China invested four times more, and the United States invested approximately 75 times more.

ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** Despite the challenges, India has made significant progress in science and technology education and continues to build infrastructure and policies to support growth.

## Research and Development (R&D)

Research and Development, commonly referred to as R&D, is the process by which an organization acquires new knowledge to create new technology, products, services, or systems. These innovations may be used internally, sold to the market, or applied to improve existing product lines. Investing in R&D is essential for maintaining a competitive edge in the market.

### Types of Research

1. **Basic Research**:  
   Basic research is conducted to gain new knowledge without a specific application or product in mind. An example would be research in pure mathematics.

2. **Applied Research**:  
   Applied research aims to solve specific problems or develop products with a clear goal in mind, such as designing a more efficient mousetrap.
