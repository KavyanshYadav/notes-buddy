## Graphical and Analytical Treatment of Concurrent and Non-Concurrent Coplanar Forces

### Definition
**Coplanar forces** are forces acting in the same plane. These forces can be further categorized based on their point of action:  
- **Concurrent Forces:** Forces that act through a single point.  
- **Non-Concurrent Forces:** Forces that do not meet at a single point but lie in the same plane.  

---

### Types of Coplanar Forces

#### **1. Concurrent Coplanar Forces:**
- All forces intersect or act through a **common point**.  
- The resultant can be determined using both **graphical** and **analytical** methods.  
- Example: Forces acting on a **suspended lamp** connected to a single point.  

#### **2. Non-Concurrent Coplanar Forces:**
- Forces lie in the same plane but do not meet at a single point.  
- Require advanced techniques to find the **resultant** and **equilibrium conditions**.  
- Example: Forces acting on a **beam supported at multiple points**.

---

### Graphical Treatment of Concurrent Coplanar Forces

#### **Method:**
- Use a **vector diagram** where each force is represented as a vector with magnitude and direction.  
- Forces are drawn **head-to-tail** to find the resultant.  

#### **Steps:**
1. Draw the forces to scale using a **suitable vector scale**.  
2. Arrange vectors head to tail.  
3. The **closing line** represents the **resultant force**.  

#### **Parallelogram Law of Forces:**
- If two concurrent forces act at an angle, their resultant can be found using the **parallelogram law**.  
- Formula:  
  $$ R = \sqrt{F_1^2 + F_2^2 + 2F_1F_2 \cos(\theta)} $$  


---

### Analytical Treatment of Concurrent Coplanar Forces

#### **Method:**
- Break down each force into its **horizontal (X-axis)** and **vertical (Y-axis)** components.  
- Apply equations of equilibrium:  

   $$ \sum F_x = 0 $$  
   $$ \sum F_y = 0 $$  

#### **Steps:**
1. Resolve all forces into **X and Y components**.  
2. Apply equilibrium conditions.  
3. Solve for the **resultant** using:  
   $$ R_x = \sum F_x, \quad R_y = \sum F_y $$  
   $$ R = \sqrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2} $$  

---

### Graphical Treatment of Non-Concurrent Coplanar Forces

#### **Method:**

A **plane truss** is a structural framework composed of straight members connected at their ends by **joints** to form a rigid structure. These structures are commonly used in **bridges**, **roofs**, and **towers** for efficient load distribution.

---

### **Equilibrium Concepts in Plane Trusses:**
**Equilibrium** is the state where all external forces and moments acting on a structure result in **zero net force** and **zero net moment**. For a structure to be in equilibrium:

- **Sum of all horizontal forces = 0:**  
   $$ \sum F_x = 0 $$
- **Sum of all vertical forces = 0:**  
   $$ \sum F_y = 0 $$
- **Sum of all moments = 0:**  
   $$ \sum M = 0 $$  

These conditions ensure that the structure is stable and not in motion.

---

### **Basic Assumptions for Truss Analysis:**
- All members are **weightless** (self-weight neglected).  
- Loads are applied only at the **joints**.  
- Members are connected by **frictionless pins**.  
- Members are **two-force members**, either in **tension** or **compression**.  

---

## **Method of Joints (Graphical and Analytical Approach)**

---

### **Steps to Analyze a Plane Truss Using the Method of Joints:**

#### **Step 1: Draw the Free Body Diagram (FBD)**
- Isolate the entire truss and draw a **free body diagram**.  
- Indicate all **external forces**, including **support reactions** and **applied loads**.  

---

#### **Step 2: Calculate Support Reactions**

   - $$ \sum F_x = 0 $$  
   - $$ \sum F_y = 0 $$  
   - $$ \sum M = 0 $$  

---

#### **Step 3: Select a Joint with Two Unknown Forces**
- Start with a **joint** where only **two unknown forces** exist.  
- Apply **equilibrium equations**:  
   $$ \sum F_x = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum F_y = 0 $$  

---

#### **Step 4: Resolve Forces into Components**
- Break all forces into **horizontal** and **vertical** components.

   - Vertical: $$ \sum F_y = 0 $$  

---

#### **Step 6: Repeat for Remaining Joints**
- Move sequentially to each joint until all **internal forces** are determined.  

---

### **Force Identification: Tension vs Compression**
- If the **calculated force** is **positive**, the member is in **tension** (pulling apart).  
- If the **calculated force** is **negative**, the member is in **compression** (pushing together).  

---

## **Applications of the Method of Joints:**
- **Bridge Design:** Analyzing load distribution across bridge trusses.  
- **Roof Trusses:** Ensuring structural stability in roofing frameworks.  
- **Transmission Towers:** Distributing forces in electrical towers.

## Method of Sections

### **Definition:**
The **Method of Sections** is a technique used in structural analysis to determine the internal forces acting in specific members of a **truss**. It involves cutting the truss into sections and applying the principles of **equilibrium** to solve for the unknown forces directly, without analyzing every joint.

---

### **Purpose of the Method of Sections:**
- To solve for **internal forces** in specific members quickly.  
- To reduce the complexity when dealing with **large trusses**.

---

### **Step 3: Select the Section to Cut**
- Choose a section that **cuts through no more than 3 members** where the forces need to be determined.  
- The section should divide the truss into **two parts**.  

---

### **Step 4: Isolate One Section of the Truss**
- Consider either the **left** or **right** section after the cut.  
- Remove the cut members and replace them with **unknown forces** acting in their respective directions.  

---

### **Step 5: Apply Equilibrium Equations:**
- Use the following equations for the isolated section:  
   - **Horizontal Force Balance:** $$ \sum F_x = 0 $$  
   - **Vertical Force Balance:** $$ \sum F_y = 0 $$  
   - **Moment Balance:** $$ \sum M = 0 $$  

#### **Moment Equation:**
- Taking moments around a point eliminates **two of the three unknown forces**, simplifying calculations.  

---

### **Step 6: Solve for the Unknown Forces**
- Solve the equations for the **unknown forces**.  
- Determine if the forces are in **tension** or **compression**:  
   - **Positive Force:** Tension (Pulling apart)  
   - **Negative Force:** Compression (Pushing together)  

---

### **Force Identification:**
- **Tension:** Force acts **away** from the joint.

## Frictional Force in Equilibrium Problems

### **Definition:**
**Frictional force** is the resistive force that opposes the relative motion or tendency of motion between two surfaces in contact. It plays a crucial role in **equilibrium problems** by preventing objects from sliding or moving when external forces act on them.

---

### **Types of Friction:**

#### **1. Static Friction ($$f_s$$):**
- Acts when the object is **at rest**.  
- Prevents the initiation of motion.  
- Maximum static friction is reached just before the object starts to move.  
- Formula:  
   $$ f_s \leq \mu_s N $$  
   where:  
   $$ \mu_s $$ = Coefficient of static friction  
   $$ N $$ = Normal force  

---

#### **2. Kinetic Friction ($$f_k$$):**
- Acts when the object is already **in motion**.  
- Magnitude is generally less than static friction.  
- Formula:  
   $$ f_k = \mu_k N $$  
   where:  
   $$ \mu_k $$ = Coefficient of kinetic friction  
   $$ N $$ = Normal force  

---

#### **3. Rolling Friction:**
- Acts on **rolling objects** like wheels and spheres.  
- Much lower compared to static and kinetic friction.

---

### **Laws of Friction:**
- **Friction acts parallel** to the contact surface.  
- **Friction depends** on the nature of surfaces.  
- **Friction is independent** of the contact area for solid surfaces.  
- **Static friction** is generally greater than **kinetic friction**.

---

### **Friction in Equilibrium Problems:**

In equilibrium problems involving friction, the body remains stationary or moves with constant velocity under the action of applied forces. The frictional force prevents **slipping** and ensures stability.

---

### **Key Equilibrium Conditions with Friction:**
- **Sum of forces in the horizontal direction = 0:**  
   $$ \sum F_x = 0 $$  
- **Sum of forces in the vertical direction = 0:**  
   $$ \sum F_y = 0 $$  
- **Sum of moments about any point = 0:**  
   $$ \sum M = 0 $$  

---

### **Steps to Solve Equilibrium Problems Involving Friction:**

#### **Step 1: Draw a Free Body Diagram (FBD)**
- Represent the object and all forces acting on it.  
- Include:  
   - **Applied force (F)**  
   - **Frictional force (f)**  
   - **Normal force (N)**  
   - **Weight (W = mg)**  

---

#### **Step 2: Identify Forces and Friction Type**
- Determine whether **static** or **kinetic** friction applies.  
- Calculate **normal force (N)**:  
   $$ N = mg $$ for flat surfaces  
   $$ N = mg \cos(\theta) $$ for inclined planes  

---

#### **Step 3: Apply Equilibrium Conditions**
- Use $$ \sum F_x = 0 $$ and $$ \sum F_y = 0 $$ equations.  
- Check if the object is **on the verge of motion** by comparing applied force and maximum static friction:  
   $$ f_s = \mu_s N $$.  

---

#### **Step 4: Solve for Unknowns**
- If frictional force $$f_s$$ prevents motion, the object is in **equilibrium**.  
- If the applied force exceeds the maximum static friction, switch to **kinetic friction**.  

---

### **Example Problem (Friction on an Inclined Plane)**:

A block of mass **10 kg** is resting on a rough incline of angle **30°** with a coefficient of static friction $$ \mu_s = 0.5 $$. Determine whether the block will slide.

#### **Step 1: Forces Acting on the Block**
- Weight $$W = mg = 10 \times 9.81 = 98.1 \ N$$.  
- Normal Force:  
   $$ N = mg \cos(\theta) = 98.1 \times \cos(30^\circ) = 84.96 \ N $$.  
- Frictional Force:  
   $$ f_s = \mu_s N = 0.5 \times 84.96 = 42.48 \ N $$.  
- Force due to gravity down the incline:  
   $$ F_g = mg \sin(\theta) = 98.1 \times \sin(30^\circ) = 49.05 \ N $$.  

#### **Step 2: Check Equilibrium Condition:**
- Since $$ F_g = 49.05 \ N > f_s = 42.48 \ N $$, the block will **slide down** the incline.  

---

- ✅ Essential for **load transfer** in construction.  

---

### **Limitations and Challenges:**
- ❌ **Excessive friction** can lead to wear and heat generation.  
- ❌ **Insufficient friction** may cause instability.  

---

✅ **Key Takeaway:**  
- **Frictional forces** play a critical role in maintaining equilibrium by opposing motion.  
- Proper **understanding of friction** is crucial for solving **equilibrium problems** accurately.
