## Simple Problems on Transformation Ratio

### Introduction
The **transformation ratio** (also called the turn ratio) defines the relationship between the primary and secondary voltage of a transformer based on the number of turns in each winding.

The formula for the **transformation ratio** is:

$$ \frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s} = \frac{I_s}{I_p} $$

Where:
- $$V_p$$ = Primary Voltage  
- $$V_s$$ = Secondary Voltage  
- $$N_p$$ = Number of turns in the primary winding  
- $$N_s$$ = Number of turns in the secondary winding  
- $$I_p$$ = Primary Current  
- $$I_s$$ = Secondary Current  

---

### **Problem 1: Step-Up Transformer Calculation**
**A transformer has 500 turns on the primary side and 1000 turns on the secondary side. If the primary voltage is 230 V, calculate the secondary voltage.**

#### **Solution:**
Using the transformation ratio formula:

$$ \frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s} $$

Rearrange to solve for $$V_s$$:

$$ V_s = \frac{N_s}{N_p} \times V_p $$

Substitute the values:

$$ V_s = \frac{1000}{500} \times 230 = 2 \times 230 = 460 \ V $$

**Answer:** The secondary voltage is **460 V**.

---

### **Problem 2: Step-Down Transformer Calculation**
**A transformer has 200 turns on the primary winding and 50 turns on the secondary winding. If the secondary voltage is 25 V, calculate the primary voltage.**

#### **Solution:**
Using the same formula:

$$ \frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s} $$

Rearrange to solve for $$V_p$$:

$$ V_p = \frac{N_p}{N_s} \times V_s $$

Substitute the values:

$$ V_p = \frac{200}{50} \times 25 = 4 \times 25 = 100 \ V $$

**Answer:** The primary voltage is **100 V**.

---

### **Problem 3: Current Transformation in a Step-Up Transformer**
**A step-up transformer has a primary current of 10 A. If the primary and secondary turns are 300 and 600 respectively, calculate the secondary current.**

#### **Solution:**
The current ratio is inversely proportional to the turns ratio:

$$ \frac{I_s}{I_p} = \frac{N_p}{N_s} $$

Rearrange to solve for $$I_s$$:

$$ I_s = \frac{N_p}{N_s} \times I_p $$

Substitute the values:

$$ I_s = \frac{300}{600} \times 10 = 0.5 \times 10 = 5 \ A $$

**Answer:** The secondary current is **5 A**.

---

### **Key Observations:**
- **Step-Up Transformer:** Secondary voltage increases, secondary current decreases.  
- **Step-Down Transformer:** Secondary voltage decreases, secondary current increases.

## Single Phase Induction Motor: Double Revolving Field Theory and Working Principle

### Introduction
A **Single-Phase Induction Motor (SPIM)** is a type of AC motor used in low-power applications where a three-phase supply is unavailable. Unlike three-phase motors, it **requires an auxiliary method** to start due to its inability to self-start. To explain its working, the **Double Revolving Field Theory** is commonly used.

---

### Double Revolving Field Theory
The **Double Revolving Field Theory** is used to explain the working of a **single-phase induction motor**. It states that:

### **Key Concept:**
- A **single-phase alternating current** produces a pulsating magnetic field, not a rotating one.  
- This pulsating magnetic field can be mathematically represented as the **sum of two rotating magnetic fields** of **equal magnitude** but **opposite directions**.

### **How it Works:**
1. The single-phase AC supply produces a pulsating magnetic field.  
2. This field can be divided into two **rotating magnetic fields**:  
   - One rotating **clockwise**.  
   - One rotating **counterclockwise**.  
3. When the rotor is stationary, these opposing forces cancel each other, leading to **zero net torque**.  
4. To start the motor, an external method (like a starting winding) is required to create **initial rotation**.  
5. Once the motor starts rotating, the backward rotating field weakens due to **rotor inertia**, and the motor continues to run based on the forward rotating magnetic field.

---

### **Mathematical Representation:**
The pulsating magnetic field $$ B(t) $$ can be expressed as:

$$ B(t) = B_{max} \cos(\omega t) $$

This can be split into two rotating fields:

$$ B_1(t) = \frac{B_{max}}{2} \cos(\omega t) $$  
$$ B_2(t) = \frac{B_{max}}{2} \cos(\omega t + 180^\circ) $$  

---

### **Need for Diagram:**
**A diagram would be helpful to visualize the two rotating fields and the resultant magnetic effect.**

### Working Principle of Single Phase Induction Motor
A **single-phase induction motor** works based on **Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction** and **Double Revolving Field Theory**.

### **Step-by-Step Working:**
1. **AC Supply Applied:**
   - When AC supply is given to the stator winding, it generates a **pulsating magnetic field**.  
2. **Magnetic Field Decomposition:**
   - The pulsating magnetic field is split into two rotating fields of **equal magnitude** but **opposite direction**.  
3. **Initial Condition (Rotor Stationary):**
   - When the rotor is stationary, no net torque is produced due to the cancellation of both fields.  
4. **Starting the Motor (Using Auxiliary Winding):**
   - To start the motor, an **auxiliary winding** or **capacitor** is added to create a **phase difference** between the currents.  
   - This phase difference generates an **unbalanced magnetic field**, providing **initial torque**.  
5. **Continuous Rotation:**
   - Once the rotor starts moving, the backward rotating field weakens, and the motor continues to rotate due to the forward rotating magnetic field.  

---

### **Key Formula for Torque (Simplified):**
The net torque developed by the motor is proportional to the magnetic flux:

$$ T \propto B_{max} \times I $$

Where:
- $$T$$ = Torque  
- $$B_{max}$$ = Maximum Magnetic Flux  
- $$I$$ = Current Flow  

---

### **Starting Methods for Single Phase Induction Motor:**
Since single-phase motors cannot self-start, they use external mechanisms:

### 1. **Split Phase Motor:**
   - Uses an additional **starting winding** with a higher resistance.  
   - Once the motor reaches a certain speed, the starting winding disconnects via a **centrifugal switch**.  

### 2. **Capacitor Start Motor:**
   - Uses a **capacitor** in series with the starting winding.  
   - The capacitor creates a **phase difference** between the two windings, improving starting torque.  

### 3. **Capacitor Start Capacitor Run Motor:**
   - Two capacitors used:  
     - **Starting Capacitor** for initial high torque.  
     - **Running Capacitor** for continuous efficiency.  

### 4. **Shaded Pole Motor:**
   - Simplest design with **shading coils** around part of the pole.  
   - Produces a weak rotating magnetic field but low efficiency.  

---

### **Advantages of Single Phase Induction Motors:**

- Reliable and requires minimal maintenance.  

### **Disadvantages:**

---

### **Conclusion:**
The **Single Phase Induction Motor** works on the principle of the **Double Revolving Field Theory** and requires an external method for starting. Its simplicity and reliability make it suitable for household and low-power industrial applications.

## Starting Methods of Single Phase Induction Motor

### Introduction
A **Single Phase Induction Motor (SPIM)** is **not self-starting** because the alternating magnetic field produced by a single-phase supply creates two equal and opposite rotating magnetic fields that cancel each other when the rotor is stationary. Therefore, external mechanisms are required to initiate the rotation of the motor, known as **starting methods**.

---

### 1. **Split Phase Induction Motor**
**Principle:**  
The motor uses two windings:  
- **Main Winding:** Connected directly to the AC supply.  
- **Starting Winding:** Connected in parallel with a higher resistance.

**Working:**
- When the motor starts, both windings produce magnetic fields.  
- Due to the difference in current phase, a **starting torque** is generated.  
- Once the motor reaches about **75-80%** of its rated speed, a **centrifugal switch** disconnects the starting winding.

**Advantages:**  
- Simple and inexpensive.

**Working:**
- When AC supply is given, the shaded pole creates a delayed magnetic field.  
- This phase difference between the main and shaded poles produces a weak rotating magnetic field, causing the rotor to turn.  

**Advantages:**  
- Simple and low-cost design.  
**Disadvantages:**  
- Low starting torque.  
- Very low efficiency.  

**Applications:**
