---

### **Graphical Representation of Ohmâ€™s Law:**

## Source Transformation

### Introduction

- Voltage Source: A circle with a $$+$$ and $$-$$ sign and a series resistor.

---

### **Key Points to Remember:**
- The resistance remains the **same** during transformation.

## Kirchhoffâ€™s Laws

### Introduction
**Kirchhoff's Laws** are fundamental principles in electrical circuit analysis, developed by **Gustav Kirchhoff** in 1845. These laws help in analyzing complex electrical circuits by defining the relationships between currents and voltages in a circuit.

---

### **1. Kirchhoffâ€™s Current Law (KCL)**

### **Statement:**
> **The algebraic sum of all currents entering a node (junction) is equal to the sum of all currents leaving the node.**

### **Mathematical Form:**
$$ \sum I_\text{in} = \sum I_\text{out} $$

### **Explanation:**
- A **node** is a point where two or more circuit elements meet.
- Currents entering the node are considered **positive**, and currents leaving the node are considered **negative** (or vice versa, depending on sign convention).

### **Example:**
At a node with currents:  
$$ I_1 + I_2 = I_3 + I_4 $$

### **Applications:**
- Solving complex circuits with multiple nodes.
- Balancing current flow in parallel circuits.

---

### **2. Kirchhoffâ€™s Voltage Law (KVL)**

### **Statement:**
> **The algebraic sum of all voltages around a closed loop in a circuit is zero.**

### **Mathematical Form:**
$$ \sum V = 0 $$

### **Explanation:**
- A **loop** is a closed path where the starting and ending points are the same.
- Voltage drops across resistors are taken as **negative** (consuming energy).  
- Voltage rises across sources are taken as **positive** (supplying energy).

### **Example:**
In a loop containing a voltage source and resistors:

$$ V_\text{source} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 $$

or  

$$ V_\text{source} - V_1 - V_2 - V_3 = 0 $$

### **Applications:**
- Used to calculate voltages in mesh analysis.
- Essential for series circuits.

---

### **Key Differences between KCL and KVL:**

| Feature                        | Kirchhoffâ€™s Current Law (KCL)      | Kirchhoffâ€™s Voltage Law (KVL)       |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Focus**                      | Current at a node/junction        | Voltage in a closed loop           |
| **Based On**                   | Conservation of charge            | Conservation of energy             |
| **Formula**                    | $$ \sum I = 0 $$                  | $$ \sum V = 0 $$                   |
| **Application**                | Parallel circuits and nodal analysis | Series circuits and mesh analysis  |

---

### **Example Problem Using KCL and KVL:**
### Given Circuit:
- $$ V = 12V $$  
- $$ R_1 = 6\Omega $$, $$ R_2 = 4\Omega $$  
- Current splits between two branches after the source.

### **Using KCL:**
At the node:  
$$ I = I_1 + I_2 $$

### **Using KVL (for loop 1):**
$$ V - I_1 \times R_1 = 0 $$ âŸ¹ $$ I_1 = \frac{12}{6} = 2A $$

### **Using KVL (for loop 2):**
$$ V - I_2 \times R_2 = 0 $$ âŸ¹ $$ I_2 = \frac{12}{4} = 3A $$

### **By KCL:**
$$ I = I_1 + I_2 = 2 + 3 = 5A $$

---

### **Applications of Kirchhoffâ€™s Laws:**
- Analyzing **complex circuits** with multiple loops and branches.
- Forming the foundation for **Mesh Analysis** and **Nodal Analysis**.
- Valid in **DC** and **AC** circuits.

---

### **Limitations:**
- Applicable only in **lumped circuits** (where elements are localized).
- Assumes **constant** physical properties (resistance, capacitance).

## Mesh Analysis

### **Introduction**
**Mesh Analysis** (also called the **Mesh Current Method**) is a systematic technique used to calculate the current in electrical circuits with multiple loops. It is based on **Kirchhoffâ€™s Voltage Law (KVL)**, which states that the sum of all voltages around a closed loop is zero.

---

### **Definition:**
> **Mesh Analysis** involves assigning a mesh current to each independent loop in the circuit and using KVL to write equations for the loops to solve for the currents.

---

### **Key Concepts:**
### **1. Mesh:**
   - A mesh is a loop in a circuit that does not enclose other loops.
   - Each mesh is assigned a unique **mesh current** (clockwise is usually standard).

### **2. Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) Application:**
   - Apply KVL to each mesh and write equations where the sum of voltage drops equals zero.

---

### **Steps for Mesh Analysis:**

### **Step 1: Identify the Meshes**
- Count the number of independent loops in the circuit.
  
### **Step 2: Assign Mesh Currents**
- Assign a unique mesh current to each loop (clockwise convention is preferred).

### **Step 3: Apply KVL to Each Mesh**
- Write KVL equations for each loop:
   $$ \sum V = 0 $$

### **Step 4: Solve the Simultaneous Equations**
- Solve the system of linear equations to find the mesh currents.

---

### **Example Problem:**
**Given Circuit:**
- Voltage Source: $$ V = 12V $$  
- $$ R_1 = 6 \Omega $$, $$ R_2 = 4 \Omega $$, $$ R_3 = 2 \Omega $$  

**Step 1: Assign Mesh Currents:**
- Mesh 1: $$ I_1 $$  
- Mesh 2: $$ I_2 $$  

**Step 2: Write KVL Equations:**

**For Mesh 1:**
$$ 12 - (6I_1) - (4(I_1 - I_2)) = 0 $$

**Simplify:**
$$ 12 = 10I_1 - 4I_2 $$

---

**For Mesh 2:**
$$ 4(I_2 - I_1) + 2I_2 = 0 $$

**Simplify:**
$$ 4I_2 - 4I_1 + 2I_2 = 0 $$ âŸ¹ $$ 6I_2 - 4I_1 = 0 $$

---

**Step 3: Solve Simultaneously:**
From the two equations:

- $$ 10I_1 - 4I_2 = 12 $$  
- $$ -4I_1 + 6I_2 = 0 $$

Solving gives:  
$$ I_1 = 2A $$, $$ I_2 = 1.33A $$

---

### **Advantages of Mesh Analysis:**
- Simplifies circuit analysis for **planar circuits**.
- Reduces the number of equations compared to node analysis for specific cases.

---

### **Limitations:**
- Applicable only to **planar circuits** (circuits that can be drawn without crossing wires).
- Less effective for circuits with many independent voltage sources.

## Nodal Analysis

### **Introduction**
**Nodal Analysis** (also called the **Node Voltage Method**) is a systematic technique used to determine the voltages at various points (nodes) in an electrical circuit. It is based on **Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)**, which states that the sum of currents entering a node equals the sum of currents leaving the node.

---

### **Key Concepts:**
### **Node:**
   - A point where two or more circuit elements meet.
   - Each node has a **node voltage** relative to a reference point (ground).

### **Reference Node (Ground):**
   - One node is chosen as the **reference node** and is assigned a voltage of **0 V**.

### **Non-Reference Nodes:**
   - Nodes where voltages need to be calculated.

---

### **Principle of Nodal Analysis:**
- Assign a voltage variable for each non-reference node.  
- Apply **KCL**: The sum of currents entering a node equals the sum of currents leaving the node.  
- Express currents in terms of node voltages and resistances using **Ohmâ€™s Law**.

---

### **Steps for Nodal Analysis:**

### **Step 1: Identify Nodes and Assign Voltages**
- Select a reference node (ground).  
- Label all non-reference nodes with voltages $$ V_1, V_2, \ldots $$.

### **Step 2: Apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)**
- For each non-reference node, apply KCL:  
   $$ \sum I_\text{in} = \sum I_\text{out} $$

### **Step 3: Express Currents Using Ohmâ€™s Law**
- $$ I = \frac{V}{R} $$.  
- Write currents in terms of node voltages and resistances.

### **Step 4: Solve the Simultaneous Equations**
- Solve the resulting simultaneous equations to find node voltages.

---

### **Example Problem:**
**Circuit:**
- Voltage source $$ V = 12V $$  
- $$ R_1 = 6\Omega $$, $$ R_2 = 4\Omega $$, $$ R_3 = 2\Omega $$  

### **Step 1: Identify Nodes:**
- Reference node: Ground  
- Nodes: $$ V_1 $$ and $$ V_2 $$

---

### **Step 2: Apply KCL:**

**At Node $$V_1$$:**
$$
\frac{V_1 - 12}{6} + \frac{V_1 - V_2}{4} = 0
$$

**At Node $$V_2$$:**
$$
\frac{V_2 - V_1}{4} + \frac{V_2}{2} = 0
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve the Equations:**
Simplify the equations:

1) $$ \frac{V_1 - 12}{6} + \frac{V_1 - V_2}{4} = 0 $$  
2) $$ \frac{V_2 - V_1}{4} + \frac{V_2}{2} = 0 $$

Solving simultaneously gives:  
- $$ V_1 = 9.6V $$  
- $$ V_2 = 4.8V $$

---

### **Advantages of Nodal Analysis:**
- Suitable for **non-planar** circuits.  
- Fewer equations compared to mesh analysis in circuits with multiple nodes.  

---

### **Limitations:**
- Not ideal for circuits with many **voltage sources**.  
- Limited to **linear circuits**.  

---

### **Applications:**

- Analysing circuits with dependent sources and operational amplifiers.  

## Voltage and Current Division Rules

### **Introduction**
The **Voltage Division Rule (VDR)** and **Current Division Rule (CDR)** are fundamental principles used in circuit analysis to determine how voltage and current are distributed among series and parallel components, respectively.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **1. Voltage Division Rule (VDR)**

### **Definition:**
> The Voltage Division Rule states that in a series circuit, the voltage across a resistor is proportional to its resistance relative to the total resistance of the circuit.

### **Formula:**
For a series circuit with resistors $$R_1, R_2, \ldots R_n$$ and total voltage $$V_{total}$$:

The voltage across any resistor $$R_x$$:

$$
V_x = V_{total} \times \frac{R_x}{R_{total}}
$$

where:  
- $$ R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + \ldots + R_n $$  
- $$ V_x $$ = Voltage across resistor $$R_x$$  
- $$ V_{total} $$ = Total applied voltage

---

### **Example Problem (VDR):**
**Given:**
- Voltage Source: $$ V_{total} = 24V $$  
- $$ R_1 = 6 \Omega $$  
- $$ R_2 = 4 \Omega $$  

**Find the voltage across $$R_2$$:**

$$
V_2 = 24 \times \frac{4}{6 + 4}
$$

$$
V_2 = 24 \times \frac{4}{10} = 9.6V
$$

âœ… **Voltage across $$R_2$$ is 9.6V.**

---

### ðŸ“Œ **2. Current Division Rule (CDR)**

### **Definition:**
> The Current Division Rule states that in a parallel circuit, the current through a branch is inversely proportional to the resistance of that branch relative to the total equivalent resistance.

### **Formula:**
For a parallel circuit with resistors $$R_1, R_2, \ldots R_n$$ and total current $$I_{total}$$:

The current through a resistor $$R_x$$:

$$
I_x = I_{total} \times \frac{\frac{1}{R_x}}{\sum{\frac{1}{R}}}
$$

For two resistors in parallel:  

$$
I_1 = I_{total} \times \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}
$$

$$
I_2 = I_{total} \times \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2}
$$

---

### **Example Problem (CDR):**
**Given:**
- Current Source: $$ I_{total} = 10A $$  
- $$ R_1 = 6 \Omega $$  
- $$ R_2 = 4 \Omega $$  

**Find the current through $$R_1$$:**

$$
I_1 = 10 \times \frac{4}{6 + 4}
$$

$$
I_1 = 10 \times \frac{4}{10} = 4A
$$

âœ… **Current through $$R_1$$ is 4A.**

### **Configuration:**
- Resistors: $$ R_1, R_2, R_3 $$  
- Common Node: Center of the star  
- Terminals: $$A, B, C$$

A **Delta (Î”)** network has three resistors connected in a closed triangular loop with three terminals.

### **Configuration:**
- Resistors: $$ R_{AB}, R_{BC}, R_{CA} $$  
- Terminals: $$A, B, C$$

---

$$
R_{AB} = \frac{R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_3 R_1}{R_1}
$$

$$
R_{BC} = \frac{R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_3 R_1}{R_2}

## Theveninâ€™s and Nortonâ€™s Theorems

### **Introduction**
**Theveninâ€™s and Nortonâ€™s Theorems** are fundamental concepts in electrical circuit analysis that simplify complex circuits into simpler equivalent circuits. They help in analyzing circuits with multiple components by reducing them into a single voltage or current source with an equivalent resistance.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Theveninâ€™s Theorem**

### **Statement:**
> Any linear electrical circuit with multiple resistors and sources can be reduced to a single **voltage source** $$V_{th}$$ in series with an equivalent resistance $$R_{th}$$.

### **Theveninâ€™s Equivalent Circuit:**
- **$$V_{th}$$**: Thevenin's equivalent voltage (open-circuit voltage).  
- **$$R_{th}$$**: Thevenin's equivalent resistance.  

### **Steps to Apply Theveninâ€™s Theorem:**
1. **Identify the Load:**
   - Choose the component across which the circuit needs simplification.

2. **Calculate Thevenin's Equivalent Voltage $$V_{th}$$:**
   - Remove the load resistor.  
   - Calculate the open-circuit voltage across the load terminals.

3. **Calculate Thevenin's Equivalent Resistance $$R_{th}$$:**
   - Turn off all independent sources (voltage sources shorted, current sources opened).  
   - Calculate the equivalent resistance seen from the open terminals.

4. **Draw Thevenin's Equivalent Circuit:**
   - Replace the original circuit with a voltage source $$V_{th}$$ in series with $$R_{th}$$.

---

### **Example Problem (Theveninâ€™s Theorem)**

**Given:**  
- Voltage Source $$V = 12V$$  
- $$R_1 = 6 \Omega$$, $$R_2 = 4 \Omega$$  
- Load Resistor: $$R_L = 10 \Omega$$

**Step 1:** Remove $$R_L$$.  
**Step 2:** Calculate $$V_{th}$$ (voltage across open terminals):  
- Voltage divider rule:  
  $$V_{th} = V \times \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$$  
  $$V_{th} = 12 \times \frac{4}{6 + 4} = 4.8V$$

**Step 3:** Calculate $$R_{th}$$:  
- Turn off voltage source (replace with a short circuit).  
- Equivalent resistance:  
  $$R_{th} = R_1 || R_2 = \frac{6 \times 4}{6 + 4} = 2.4 \Omega$$

âœ… **Theveninâ€™s Equivalent Circuit:**  
- $$V_{th} = 4.8V$$  
- $$R_{th} = 2.4 \Omega$$

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Nortonâ€™s Theorem**

### **Statement:**
> Any linear electrical circuit can be reduced to a single **current source** $$I_{N}$$ in parallel with an equivalent resistance $$R_{N}$$.

### **Nortonâ€™s Equivalent Circuit:**
- **$$I_N$$**: Nortonâ€™s equivalent current (short-circuit current).  
- **$$R_N$$**: Nortonâ€™s equivalent resistance (same as Theveninâ€™s equivalent resistance).  

### **Steps to Apply Nortonâ€™s Theorem:**
1. **Identify the Load:**  
   - Select the component across which the circuit will be simplified.

2. **Calculate Nortonâ€™s Equivalent Current $$I_N$$:**  
   - Short the load resistor.  
   - Calculate the short-circuit current across the load terminals.

3. **Calculate Nortonâ€™s Equivalent Resistance $$R_N$$:**  
   - Same as Thevenin's resistance.  
   - Turn off all independent sources and calculate the equivalent resistance across the terminals.

4. **Draw Nortonâ€™s Equivalent Circuit:**  
   - Replace the circuit with a current source $$I_N$$ in parallel with $$R_N$$.

---

### **Example Problem (Nortonâ€™s Theorem)**

**Given:**  
- Voltage Source $$V = 12V$$  
- $$R_1 = 6 \Omega$$, $$R_2 = 4 \Omega$$  
- Load Resistor: $$R_L = 10 \Omega$$

**Step 1:** Remove $$R_L$$.  
**Step 2:** Calculate $$I_N$$ (short-circuit current):  
- Short circuit the load terminals:  
  $$I_N = \frac{V}{R_1 + R_2} = \frac{12}{10} = 1.2A$$

**Step 3:** Calculate $$R_N$$ (same as $$R_{th}$$):  
- $$R_N = R_1 || R_2 = 2.4 \Omega$$

âœ… **Nortonâ€™s Equivalent Circuit:**  
- $$I_N = 1.2A$$  
- $$R_N = 2.4 \Omega$$

### ðŸ“Œ **Relationship Between Theveninâ€™s and Nortonâ€™s Theorems:**
- The **Theveninâ€™s Voltage Source** can be converted into a **Nortonâ€™s Current Source** and vice versa.  
- **Conversion Formulas:**
   - $$ V_{th} = I_N \times R_N $$  
   - $$ I_N = \frac{V_{th}}{R_{th}} $$
