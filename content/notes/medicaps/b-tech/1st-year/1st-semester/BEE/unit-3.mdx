## B-H Curve and Hysteresis Loop

### Introduction
The **B-H curve** (Magnetic Flux Density vs. Magnetic Field Intensity curve) describes the relationship between magnetic flux density $$B$$ and magnetic field intensity $$H$$ for a magnetic material. It plays a crucial role in understanding the magnetic properties of materials, particularly in transformers, inductors, and other magnetic devices.

---

### **B-H Curve Explanation**
- **Magnetic Field Intensity (H):** It represents the strength of the magnetic field applied to a material.  
- **Magnetic Flux Density (B):** It represents the amount of magnetic flux generated in the material due to the applied magnetic field.  

#### Key Points on the B-H Curve:
1. **Initial Magnetization Curve:**  
   - When a magnetic material is unmagnetized and a magnetic field is applied, the magnetic flux density increases non-linearly.  
2. **Saturation Point:**  
   - At a certain point, increasing $$H$$ does not significantly increase $$B$$. The material is said to be **saturated**.  
3. **Non-Linear Behaviour:**  
   - The curve starts to bend as it reaches saturation due to the alignment of magnetic domains.  

---

### **Hysteresis Loop Explanation**
The **hysteresis loop** describes the lagging behaviour of magnetic flux density $$B$$ behind the applied magnetic field intensity $$H$$. It explains the energy loss in magnetic materials during the magnetization and demagnetization cycle.

#### Steps of the Hysteresis Loop:
1. **Initial Magnetization:**  
   - Starting from an unmagnetized state (origin).  
2. **Forward Magnetization (O to A):**  
   - As $$H$$ increases, $$B$$ rises to the saturation point **A**.  
3. **Reducing H (A to B):**  
   - When $$H$$ is reduced back to zero, some residual magnetism (retentivity) remains at point **B**.  
4. **Reversing H (B to C):**  
   - Applying a negative $$H$$ reduces $$B$$ to zero and further to the opposite saturation point **C**.  
5. **Reducing Negative H (C to D):**  
   - Removing the negative field leaves some magnetism (opposite direction).  
6. **Reapplying Positive H (D to A):**  
   - Increasing positive $$H$$ back results in another cycle, completing the **loop**.  

---

### **Key Parameters in the Hysteresis Loop**
- **Retentivity ($$B_r$$)**:  
   - The magnetic flux density left in the material when the magnetic field is zero.  
- **Coercivity ($$H_c$$)**:  
   - The amount of reverse magnetic field required to reduce the magnetic flux density to zero.  
- **Saturation Point:**  
   - The maximum flux density a material can achieve under a magnetic field.  
- **Area of the Loop:**  
   - Represents energy loss due to **hysteresis loss** during one complete cycle of magnetization and demagnetization.  

---

### **Hysteresis Loss Formula**
The energy loss per cycle of magnetization is calculated by:  

$$ W = \eta \cdot V $$  

where:  
$$W$$ = Energy loss per cycle  
$$\eta$$ = Area of the hysteresis loop  
$$V$$ = Volume of the material  

---

### **Applications of the B-H Curve and Hysteresis Loop**

*Whenever there is a change in the magnetic flux linked with a conductor, an electromotive force (EMF) is induced in the conductor.*  

#### Key Concepts:
- **Magnetic Flux ($$ \Phi $$)**: The measure of the magnetic field passing through a surface.  
- **Change in Flux:** If magnetic flux through a coil changes, it induces an EMF.  
- **Electromotive Force (EMF):** The voltage generated due to changing magnetic flux.  

#### Formula:
The magnitude of the induced EMF depends on the rate of change of magnetic flux:  
$$ \text{EMF} = - \frac{d\Phi}{dt} $$

where:  
$$\Phi$$ = Magnetic flux (Weber)  
$$t$$ = Time (seconds)  

---

### **Faraday's Second Law of Electromagnetic Induction**
**Statement:**  
*The magnitude of the induced EMF is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux and the number of turns in the coil.*  

#### Key Concepts:
- **Number of Turns (N):** More turns in the coil, higher the induced EMF.  
- **Rate of Change:** Faster change in magnetic flux increases the induced EMF.  

#### Formula:  
$$ \text{EMF} = -N \frac{d\Phi}{dt} $$  

where:  
$$N$$ = Number of turns in the coil  

---

### **Lenz's Law (Extension of Faraday's Law)**
**Statement:**  
*The direction of the induced EMF is such that it opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.*  

#### Key Concepts:
- The **negative sign** in the formula indicates opposition to the cause.  
- Ensures the conservation of energy by resisting the change.

---

### **Examples of Electromagnetic Induction:**
1. **Simple Coil and Magnet:** Moving a magnet in and out of a coil generates an EMF.  
2. **AC Generator:** Rotating a coil in a magnetic field generates alternating current.  

---

### **Key Formula Recap:**
- **EMF Induced:**  
  $$ \text{EMF} = -N \frac{d\Phi}{dt} $$  
- **Magnetic Flux:**  
  $$ \Phi = B \cdot A \cdot \cos(\theta) $$  

where:  
$$B$$ = Magnetic flux density (T)  
$$A$$ = Area of the coil (m²)  
$$\theta$$ = Angle between field and area vector

## Self Inductance and Mutual Inductance

### **Introduction**
Inductance is the property of a conductor by which a change in current induces an electromotive force (EMF). **Self inductance** and **mutual inductance** describe how this occurs in a single coil and between two coils, respectively.

---

#### **Explanation:**
- When the current in a coil changes, it generates a changing magnetic field around the coil.  
- This changing magnetic field induces an EMF that opposes the change in current (as per **Lenz's Law**).  

#### **Mathematical Formula:**  
The self-induced EMF is given by:  
$$ E = -L \frac{dI}{dt} $$

## Coefficient of Coupling

### **Introduction**
The **coefficient of coupling** ($$k$$) measures the degree to which magnetic flux from one coil links with another coil in a magnetic circuit. It indicates how effectively two coils interact magnetically and is essential in the study of transformers, inductors, and mutual inductance systems.

---

### **Definition:**
*The coefficient of coupling* is defined as the fraction of magnetic flux produced in the primary coil that links with the secondary coil. It describes the efficiency of magnetic linkage between two coils.

---

### **Mathematical Formula:**
The coefficient of coupling is given by:  

$$ k = \frac{M}{\sqrt{L_1 L_2}} $$  

where:  
- $$k$$ = Coefficient of coupling (dimensionless, $$0 \leq k \leq 1$$)  
- $$M$$ = Mutual inductance (Henry)  
- $$L_1$$ = Self-inductance of coil 1 (Henry)  
- $$L_2$$ = Self-inductance of coil 2 (Henry)  

---

### **Range of Values:**
- $$k = 1$$: **Perfect coupling** (100% flux linkage).  
- $$k = 0$$: **No coupling** (no flux linkage).  
- $$0 < k < 1$$: **Partial coupling**, common in most practical cases.  

---

### **Physical Meaning of Coefficient of Coupling:**
- If **$$k = 1$$**, all magnetic flux produced in coil 1 links with coil 2 (ideal case, rarely practical).  
- If **$$k = 0$$**, no magnetic flux from coil 1 links with coil 2 (completely isolated).  
- If **$$k = 0.5$$**, only 50% of the magnetic flux links with coil 2.  

---

### **Factors Affecting Coefficient of Coupling:**
1. **Distance Between Coils:**  
   - Greater distance reduces coupling.  
2. **Relative Orientation:**  
   - Coils parallel to each other have better coupling.  
3. **Core Material:**  
   - High permeability materials improve coupling.  
4. **Number of Turns:**  
   - More turns improve magnetic linkage.  

---

### **Mutual Inductance and Coefficient of Coupling Relation:**
The mutual inductance can be derived from the coefficient of coupling:  

$$ M = k \sqrt{L_1 L_2} $$  

---

### **Applications of Coefficient of Coupling:**
- **Transformers:** Determines energy transfer efficiency between primary and secondary windings.  
- **Wireless Charging:** Higher coupling improves power transfer efficiency.  
- **Inductive Sensors:** Used in metal detectors and proximity sensors.  

---

### **Practical Example:**
If:  
- $$L_1 = 4 \, \text{H}$$  
- $$L_2 = 9 \, \text{H}$$  
- $$M = 6 \, \text{H}$$  

Then:  
$$k = \frac{6}{\sqrt{4 \cdot 9}} = \frac{6}{6} = 1$$  
**This indicates perfect coupling.**  

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
- The coefficient of coupling measures magnetic flux linkage between two coils.  
- Perfect coupling is rare; most practical systems have partial coupling.  
- It directly affects mutual inductance and transformer efficiency.

---

### **Inductance in Series Without Magnetic Coupling:**
For coils not magnetically coupled, the total inductance is simply the sum of individual inductances:  

$$ L_{\text{total}} = L_1 + L_2 + L_3 + \ldots + L_n $$  

---

### **Inductance in Series With Magnetic Coupling:**
When coils are magnetically coupled, mutual inductance must be considered. The total inductance is affected by the **coefficient of coupling (k)**.  

- If the coils aid each other (magnetic flux reinforces):  
  $$ L_{\text{total}} = L_1 + L_2 + 2M $$  

- If the coils oppose each other (magnetic flux cancels):  
  $$ L_{\text{total}} = L_1 + L_2 - 2M $$

---

### **Inductance in Parallel Without Magnetic Coupling:**
For coils not magnetically coupled, the total inductance is calculated as:  

$$ \frac{1}{L_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{L_1} + \frac{1}{L_2} + \frac{1}{L_3} + \ldots + \frac{1}{L_n} $$  

---

### **Inductance in Parallel With Magnetic Coupling:**
When mutual inductance exists between parallel coils, the total inductance is:  

- If the coils aid each other:  
  $$ \frac{1}{L_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{L_1} + \frac{1}{L_2} + \frac{2M}{L_1 L_2} $$  

- If the coils oppose each other:  
  $$ \frac{1}{L_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{L_1} + \frac{1}{L_2} - \frac{2M}{L_1 L_2} $$  

---

### **Key Characteristics:**
- **Voltage:** Same across all coils.  
- **Current:** Divided among the coils based on inductances.  
- **Inductance:** Total inductance is **lower** than individual inductors.  

---

### **Applications of Parallel Connection:**

| **Inductance Effect**           | Total inductance increases.        | Total inductance decreases.        |
| **Applications**                | Low-pass filters, tuning circuits. | High-frequency filters, resonance circuits.|

### **2. Statically Induced EMF**
- **Definition:** EMF induced when there is no relative motion between the conductor and magnetic field, but the magnetic flux changes with time.  
- **Example:** Transformers, inductors.  

#### **Types of Statically Induced EMF:**
- **Self-Induced EMF:**  
   - EMF induced within the same coil due to its own changing magnetic field.  
   - $$E = -L \frac{dI}{dt}$$  

- **Mutually Induced EMF:**  
   - EMF induced in a secondary coil due to the changing magnetic field created by a current in the primary coil.  
   - $$E = -M \frac{dI}{dt}$$  

---

### **3. Transformer EMF**
- **Definition:** EMF induced when alternating current (AC) flows through a coil, creating a time-varying magnetic flux that induces an EMF in another coil.  
- **Example:** Step-up and step-down transformers.  
- **Formula:**  
  $$ E = N \frac{d\Phi}{dt} $$

### **Key Differences Between Dynamically and Statically Induced EMF:**

| **Aspect**                       | **Dynamically Induced EMF**         | **Statically Induced EMF**          |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Conductor Movement**           | Conductor moves in a magnetic field. | No conductor movement.            |
| **Flux Change Mechanism**        | Due to physical movement.            | Due to changing current or flux.  |
| **Example**                      | Generator, rotating coil.            | Transformer, inductor.            |
| **Formula**                      | $$E = B \cdot l \cdot v \cdot \sin(\theta)$$ | $$E = -L \frac{dI}{dt}$$         |

## **Simple Problems:**

### **Problem 1: Calculating Dynamically Induced EMF**
**A conductor of length 0.5 m moves perpendicularly with a velocity of 3 m/s through a magnetic field of 0.8 T. Calculate the induced EMF.**  

**Solution:**  
Given:  
$$B = 0.8 \ T$$  
$$l = 0.5 \ m$$  
$$v = 3 \ m/s$$  
$$\theta = 90^\circ \Rightarrow \sin(\theta) = 1$$  

Using the formula:  
$$E = B \cdot l \cdot v \cdot \sin(\theta)$$  
$$E = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 3 \cdot 1$$  
**$$E = 1.2 \ V$$**

### **Problem 2: Calculating Self-Induced EMF**
**A coil with an inductance of 2 H carries a current which changes at a rate of 4 A/s. Calculate the self-induced EMF.**  

**Solution:**  
Given:  
$$L = 2 \ H$$  
$$\frac{dI}{dt} = 4 \ A/s$$  

Using the formula:  
$$E = -L \frac{dI}{dt}$$  
$$E = -2 \cdot 4 = -8 \ V$$  

**The negative sign indicates the EMF opposes the current change (Lenz's Law).**

### **Problem 3: Calculating Mutually Induced EMF**
**Two coils have a mutual inductance of 3 H. If the current in the primary coil changes at a rate of 2 A/s, calculate the mutually induced EMF.**  

**Solution:**  
Given:  
$$M = 3 \ H$$  
$$\frac{dI}{dt} = 2 \ A/s$$  

Using the formula:  
$$E = -M \frac{dI}{dt}$$  
$$E = -3 \cdot 2 = -6 \ V$$

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Dynamically Induced EMF:** Movement required for induction.  
- **Statically Induced EMF:** No movement, flux change occurs due to varying current.  
- **Self-Induced EMF:** Within the same coil.  
- **Mutually Induced EMF:** Between two coils due to flux linkage.
