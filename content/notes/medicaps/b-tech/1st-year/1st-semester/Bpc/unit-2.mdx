# Basics of Programming Language

## 1. Character Set

A **character set** is a collection of characters that a programming language can recognize. These characters include:

- **Letters** (A-Z, a-z)
- **Digits** (0-9)
- **Special characters** (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, etc.)
- **Whitespace characters** (space, tab, newline)
- **Escape sequences** (e.g., `\n`, `\t`)

## 2. Identifier

An **identifier** is a name used to identify variables, functions, arrays, or other user-defined items. Some rules for identifiers:

- Must start with a letter (A-Z or a-z) or an underscore (_).
- The rest of the identifier can contain letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.
- Cannot be a keyword or reserved word in the language.
- Examples of valid identifiers: `myVariable`, `_count`, `totalAmount`.
- Examples of invalid identifiers: `123abc`, `@total`.

## 3. Keywords

**Keywords** are predefined, reserved words that have special meanings in the language. These cannot be used as identifiers. Common examples of keywords:

- **Java**: `public`, `private`, `class`, `int`, `if`, `else`
- **C**: `int`, `float`, `char`, `if`, `else`
- **Python**: `def`, `class`, `if`, `else`, `import`

Each programming language has its own set of keywords.

## 4. Constants

A **constant** is a value that cannot be changed during the execution of the program. Constants are typically used for fixed values. In many languages, constants are defined using a keyword like `const` or `final`.

Example:

- **Java**: `final int MAX_VALUE = 100;`
- **C**: `#define MAX_VALUE 100`
- **Python**: Python doesn't have a specific keyword for constants, but by convention, uppercase variable names are used to indicate constants (e.g., `PI = 3.14`).

## 5. Data Types

**Data types** define the type of data a variable can store. Common data types include:

- **Primitive types**: `int`, `float`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.
- **Composite types**: `arrays`, `objects`, etc.
- **User-defined types**: `struct`, `class`, etc.

### Examples of data types:
- **Java**: `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `String`
- **C**: `int`, `float`, `char`, `double`
- **Python**: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`

## 6. Variables and Declaration

A **variable** is a named storage location in memory that holds a value. The **declaration** of a variable involves specifying its name and data type.

### Syntax for declaring variables:

- **Java**: 
  ```java
  int age = 18;
  String name = "Jeet";



# Operators and Expressions

## 1. Operator Precedence and Associativity

**Operator precedence** determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first. **Associativity** defines the order in which operators of the same precedence level are evaluated, typically either from left to right (left-associative) or from right to left (right-associative).

### Example of Operator Precedence:

In the expression `3 + 5 * 2`, the multiplication operator (`*`) has higher precedence than the addition operator (`+`), so the expression is evaluated as:

```plaintext
3 + (5 * 2) = 3 + 10 = 13
```

### Example of Operator Associativity:

Consider the expression `a = b = c = 10`. The assignment operator (`=`) is right-associative, meaning it evaluates from right to left:

```plaintext
a = (b = (c = 10))
```

### Precedence Table (for common operators):

| Operator | Precedence | Associativity  |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| *, /, %  | 1          | Left to Right  |
| +, -     | 2          | Left to Right  |
| =        | 3          | Right to Left  |

## 2. Expression Evaluation (Simple Examples)

An expression is a combination of variables, constants, operators, and function calls that are evaluated to produce a value.

### Example 1: Arithmetic Expression

```java
int result = 5 + 3 * 2; // result is 11, as multiplication has higher precedence than addition
```

### Example 2: Logical Expression

```java
boolean result = (5 > 3) && (7 < 10); // result is true
```

### Example 3: Assignment Expression

```java
int x = 10;
x = x + 5; // x becomes 15
```

### Example 4: Mixed Operators

```java
int result = 10 + 5 * 2 - 4 / 2; // result is 15, following operator precedence
```

## 3. Input and Output Functions

### Input Functions

- **Java**: `Scanner` class is used for taking input from the user.

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
int num = scanner.nextInt();
```

- **C**: `scanf` function is used for taking input.

```c
int num;
printf("Enter a number: ");
scanf("%d", &num);
```

- **Python**: `input()` function is used for taking input.

```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
```

### Output Functions

- **Java**: `System.out.print()` or `System.out.println()` is used for output.

```java
System.out.println("The result is: " + result);
```

- **C**: `printf` function is used for output.

```c
printf("The result is: %d\n", result);
```

- **Python**: `print()` function is used for output.

```python
print("The result is:", result)
```

## 4. Simple Computational Problems

### Problem 1: Sum of Two Numbers

Task: Write a program to take two numbers as input and print their sum.

- **Java**:

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter first number: ");
int num1 = scanner.nextInt();
System.out.print("Enter second number: ");
int num2 = scanner.nextInt();
int sum = num1 + num2;
System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
```

- **C**:

```c
int num1, num2, sum;
printf("Enter first number: ");
scanf("%d", &num1);
printf("Enter second number: ");
scanf("%d", &num2);
sum = num1 + num2;
printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
```

- **Python**:

```python
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
sum = num1 + num2
print("Sum:", sum)
```

### Problem 2: Area of a Circle

Task: Write a program to calculate the area of a circle given its radius.

- **Java**:

```java
double radius = 5.0;
double area = Math.PI * radius * radius;
System.out.println("Area of the circle: " + area);
```

- **C**:

```c
double radius = 5.0, area;
area = 3.14159 * radius * radius;
printf("Area of the circle: %.2f\n", area);
```

- **Python**:

```python
import math
radius = 5.0
area = math.pi * radius * radius
print("Area of the circle:", area)
```

### Problem 3: Swap Two Numbers Without Using a Temporary Variable

Task: Swap two numbers without using a temporary variable.

- **Java**:

```java
int a = 5, b = 10;
a = a + b;
b = a - b;
a = a - b;
System.out.println("a: " + a + ", b: " + b);
```

- **C**:

```c
int a = 5, b = 10;
a = a + b;
b = a - b;
a = a - b;
printf("a: %d, b: %d\n", a, b);
```

- **Python**:

```python
a, b = 5, 10
a, b = b, a
print("a:", a, "b:", b)
```

## 5. Conclusion

Understanding operators, expressions, input/output functions, and simple computational problems is fundamental to writing effective programs. By practicing these concepts, you can build a strong foundation for more complex problem-solving tasks.


# Control Statements: Selection, Conditional Operator, Iteration, Branching, and Nesting

## 1. Selection Statements

Selection statements are used to choose a specific block of code to execute based on a condition. The most common selection statements in C are `if`, `if-else`, and `if-else-if`.

### Example: `if` Statement

The `if` statement is used to check a condition, and if it evaluates to true, the block of code inside the `if` statement is executed.

```c
int num = 10;
if (num > 0) {
    printf("The number is positive.\n");
}
```

In this example, the condition `num > 0` is checked, and since it is true, the message "The number is positive" is printed.

### Example: `if-else` Statement

The `if-else` statement allows you to execute one block of code if the condition is true, and another block if the condition is false.

```c
int num = -5;
if (num > 0) {
    printf("The number is positive.\n");
} else {
    printf("The number is negative.\n");
}
```

Here, since `num` is not greater than 0, the message "The number is negative" is printed.

### Example: `if-else-if` Ladder

The `if-else-if` ladder allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence.

```c
int num = 0;
if (num > 0) {
    printf("The number is positive.\n");
} else if (num < 0) {
    printf("The number is negative.\n");
} else {
    printf("The number is zero.\n");
}
```

This checks three conditions: whether the number is positive, negative, or zero, and prints the appropriate message.

## 2. Conditional Operator (Ternary Operator)

The conditional operator (`? :`) is a shorthand for the `if-else` statement. It is used to assign a value based on a condition.

### Syntax:

```c
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
```

### Example:

```c
int num = 10;
char* result = (num > 0) ? "Positive" : "Negative";
printf("%s\n", result); // Output: Positive
```

In this example, the condition `num > 0` is checked. If true, "Positive" is assigned to `result`; otherwise, "Negative" is assigned.

## 3. Iteration Statements

Iteration statements allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. The common iteration statements are `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

### 3.1 `for` Loop

A `for` loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("Iteration %d\n", i);
}
```

In this example, the loop runs 5 times, printing the iteration number each time.

### 3.2 `while` Loop

A `while` loop is used when the condition is checked before each iteration, and the loop continues as long as the condition is true.

```c
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    printf("Iteration %d\n", i);
    i++;
}
```

The loop continues to run as long as `i < 5`. The value of `i` is incremented after each iteration.

### 3.3 `do-while` Loop

A `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees at least one iteration because the condition is checked after the loop body.

```c
int i = 0;
do {
    printf("Iteration %d\n", i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

Even if the condition is false at the beginning, the loop will run at least once.

## 4. Branching Statements

Branching statements allow you to control the flow of execution in your program. The common branching statements are `switch`, `break`, `continue`, and `goto`.

### 4.1 `switch` Statement

The `switch` statement allows you to select one of many code blocks to execute based on the value of a variable.

```c
int day = 3;
switch (day) {
    case 1:
        printf("Monday\n");
        break;
    case 2:
        printf("Tuesday\n");
        break;
    case 3:
        printf("Wednesday\n");
        break;
    default:
        printf("Invalid day\n");
}
```

The `switch` statement checks the value of `day` and executes the corresponding block. If no match is found, the `default` block is executed.

### 4.2 `break` Statement

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a `switch` statement prematurely.

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        break; // Exit the loop when i is 3
    }
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
```

Here, the loop exits when `i` equals 3.

### 4.3 `continue` Statement

The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration.

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        continue; // Skip the iteration when i is 3
    }
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
```

In this case, the iteration where `i` equals 3 is skipped, and the loop continues with the next iteration.

### 4.4 `goto` Statement

The `goto` statement is used for transferring control to another part of the program. It is generally not recommended as it can lead to unstructured and difficult-to-maintain code.

```c
goto label;
...
label:
    printf("This is the label.\n");
```

In this example, the program control jumps to the `label` statement.

## 5. Nesting of Control Statements

Nesting control statements means placing one control statement inside another. This can be done with `if`, `for`, `while`, and other control structures.

### Example: Nested `if` Statement

```c
int num = 10;
if (num > 0) {
    if (num % 2 == 0) {
        printf("The number is positive and even.\n");
    } else {
        printf("The number is positive and odd.\n");
    }
} else {
    printf("The number is negative.\n");
}
```

Here, the second `if` statement is nested inside the first `if` statement to check if the number is even or odd.

### Example: Nested Loops

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        printf("i: %d, j: %d\n", i, j);
    }
}
```

This nested loop prints combinations of `i` and `j` values.

## 6. Problems Using Control Statements

### Problem 1: Find the Largest of Three Numbers

Task: Write a program to find the largest of three numbers using `if-else` statements.

```c
int num1 = 10, num2 = 20, num3 = 15;
if (num1 >= num2 && num1 >= num3) {
    printf("Largest number is: %d\n", num1);
} else if (num2 >= num1 && num2 >= num3) {
    printf("Largest number is: %d\n", num2);
} else {
    printf("Largest number is: %d\n", num3);
}
```

### Problem 2: Check Whether a Number is Prime

Task: Write a program to check if a number is prime.

```c
int num = 29, isPrime = 1;
for (int i = 2; i <= num / 2; i++) {
    if (num % i == 0) {
        isPrime = 0;
        break;
    }
}
if (isPrime) {
    printf("%d is a prime number.\n", num);
} else {
    printf("%d is not a prime number.\n", num);
}
```

## 7. Conclusion

Control statements are essential for decision-making, repetition, and branching in programs. Mastering these concepts helps you write more efficient and effective code, allowing you to solve a wide range of problems.
