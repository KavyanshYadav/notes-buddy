## Water Pollution Causes

Water pollution refers to the contamination of water bodies such as rivers, lakes, oceans, and groundwater due to harmful substances that degrade water quality, making it unsafe for consumption and disrupting aquatic ecosystems.

### Natural Causes of Water Pollution

Though human activities are the primary drivers, natural factors can also contribute to water pollution:

- **Volcanic Eruptions:** Release of ash, gases, and minerals into water bodies.
- **Soil Erosion:** Excessive sediment and nutrients washing into water bodies.
- **Algal Blooms:** Natural algae overgrowth producing toxins harmful to aquatic life.
- **Decaying Organic Matter:** Decomposition of plants and animals releasing nutrients and toxins.

### Human-Induced Causes of Water Pollution

The majority of water pollution arises from human activities, often linked to industrialization and urbanization.

#### 1. **Industrial Discharge**
   - Release of harmful chemicals such as heavy metals (lead, mercury) and toxins into water bodies.
   - Example: Textile factories discharging dye effluents into rivers.

#### 2. **Agricultural Runoff**
   - Excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides contaminates water through surface runoff.
   - Leads to **eutrophication** â€“ excessive nutrients causing algal blooms and oxygen depletion.

#### 3. **Sewage and Wastewater Disposal**
   - Untreated domestic sewage and wastewater release pathogens, bacteria, and viruses.
   - Example: Urban slums without proper drainage systems often contribute to water contamination.

#### 4. **Oil Spills**
   - Leakage from oil tankers and drilling activities pollutes oceans and seas.
   - Example: The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010.

#### 5. **Mining Activities**
   - Mining operations release heavy metals and acid mine drainage into nearby water bodies.
   - Common pollutants: arsenic, lead, cadmium.

#### 6. **Plastic Pollution**
   - Plastics and microplastics entering water bodies affect marine species and water quality.
   - Example: Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

#### 7. **Thermal Pollution**
   - Discharge of heated water from power plants or industries reduces oxygen levels in water.
   - Affects aquatic life due to temperature imbalances.

#### 8. **Radioactive Waste**
   - Leakage of radioactive substances from nuclear power plants or medical facilities.
   - Example: Fukushima nuclear disaster.

#### 9. **Urbanization and Land Development**
   - Construction activities and land clearing lead to increased sedimentation and pollutants in water.

### Effects of Water Pollution
- **Health Issues:** Spread of diseases like cholera, dysentery, and typhoid.
- **Aquatic Life Disruption:** Loss of biodiversity and fish kills.
- **Economic Impact:** Loss of fisheries, tourism, and clean water resources.

## DO, BOD, and COD

**Dissolved Oxygen (DO)**, **Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)**, and **Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)** are critical indicators of water quality. These parameters help assess the level of pollution in water bodies and their capacity to sustain aquatic life.

---

### Dissolved Oxygen (DO)

**Dissolved Oxygen (DO)** refers to the amount of oxygen present in water, which is essential for the survival of aquatic organisms.

### Importance:
- Essential for the respiration of fish and other aquatic species.
- Indicates the health of the water body.
- Influences the rate of biochemical reactions in water.

### Factors Affecting DO Levels:
- **Temperature:** Higher temperatures reduce DO levels.

- **Decomposition:** Organic matter decomposition consumes oxygen.
- **Pollution:** Excessive nutrients and pollutants lower DO levels.

### DO Measurement:
- Measured in **mg/L (milligrams per litre)**.
- Healthy water typically has **6-8 mg/L** of DO.

### Consequences of Low DO:
- Fish kills due to oxygen deficiency.
- Anaerobic conditions leading to the production of toxic gases like methane and hydrogen sulfide.

---

### Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)

**Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)** measures the amount of oxygen consumed by microorganisms during the decomposition of organic matter in water.

### Significance:
- Indicates the organic pollution level.
- High BOD suggests a high level of organic waste, leading to oxygen depletion.

### Sources of High BOD:
- Untreated sewage discharge.
- Agricultural runoff containing fertilizers and pesticides.
- Industrial waste effluents.

### Measurement:
- Measured in **mg/L** over a **5-day** period at **20Â°C**.
- **Standard for clean water:** **BOD < 3 mg/L**.
- **Heavily polluted water:** **BOD > 100 mg/L**.

### Effects of High BOD:
- Oxygen depletion leading to the death of aquatic organisms.
- Poor water quality, foul odors, and increased microbial activity.

---

### Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)

**Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)** measures the total oxygen required to chemically oxidize organic and inorganic matter in water.

### Significance:
- Indicates the overall pollution level.
- Measures both biodegradable and non-biodegradable pollutants.
- Faster test compared to BOD but less specific to biodegradable waste.

### Sources of High COD:
- Industrial effluents containing chemicals.
- Oil spills and toxic waste disposal.
- Synthetic organic compounds and detergents.

### Measurement:
- Measured in **mg/L** using chemical oxidation.
- **Clean water:** **COD < 20 mg/L**.
- **Polluted water:** **COD > 200 mg/L**.

---

### **Comparison of DO, BOD, and COD**

| Parameter | Definition | Indicates | Typical Range for Clean Water |
|-----------|------------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **DO**    | Dissolved Oxygen | Oxygen available for aquatic life | 6-8 mg/L |
| **BOD**   | Biochemical Oxygen Demand | Organic pollution from decomposable matter | < 3 mg/L |
| **COD**   | Chemical Oxygen Demand | Overall pollution including chemicals | < 20 mg/L |

---

### **Relationship Between DO, BOD, and COD**
- **DO drops** when **BOD and COD increase** due to oxygen consumption during decomposition and chemical reactions.
- **BOD** focuses on **biodegradable organic matter**, while **COD** includes **both biodegradable and non-biodegradable** pollutants.
