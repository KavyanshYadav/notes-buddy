## Concept of Ecosystem

### Definition of an Ecosystem
An **ecosystem** is a community of living organisms (plants, animals, and microbes) interacting with one another and their non-living (abiotic) environment, such as air, water, and soil, functioning as a unit. 

- **Living components (Biotic Factors):** Includes producers, consumers, and decomposers.
- **Non-living components (Abiotic Factors):** Includes sunlight, temperature, water, air, soil, and minerals.

üìù **NOTE:** The term *ecosystem* was coined by **Sir Arthur Tansley** in 1935.

---

### Components of an Ecosystem
An ecosystem is made up of two main components:

#### 1. Biotic Components (Living)
- **Producers (Autotrophs):** Organisms that produce their own food via photosynthesis (e.g., plants, algae).
- **Consumers (Heterotrophs):** Organisms that consume other organisms for energy.
  - *Primary Consumers:* Herbivores (e.g., deer, rabbits).
  - *Secondary Consumers:* Carnivores (e.g., snakes, frogs).
  - *Tertiary Consumers:* Top predators (e.g., lions, eagles).
- **Decomposers (Saprotrophs):** Break down dead matter (e.g., fungi, bacteria).

#### 2. Abiotic Components (Non-Living)
- **Climatic Factors:** Sunlight, temperature, humidity.
- **Edaphic Factors:** Soil composition, minerals.
- **Other Factors:** Air, water, pH levels.

### Types of Ecosystems
Ecosystems can be broadly classified into:

#### 1. Natural Ecosystems
- **Terrestrial Ecosystems:** Forests, grasslands, deserts.
- **Aquatic Ecosystems:** Freshwater (lakes, rivers) and marine (oceans).

#### 2. Artificial Ecosystems
- **Human-Made Ecosystems:** Gardens, aquariums, crop fields.

---

### Functions of an Ecosystem
- **Energy Flow:** Transfer of energy through food chains and food webs.
- **Nutrient Cycling:** Circulation of nutrients like nitrogen and carbon.
- **Biological Control:** Maintaining population balance through predator-prey relationships.
- **Ecosystem Services:** Providing oxygen, food, water purification, climate regulation.

üí° **TIP:** Ecosystems maintain a delicate balance where all components are interdependent.

---

### Key Characteristics of an Ecosystem

## Food Chains

### Definition of Food Chain
A **food chain** is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass as one organism eats another. It represents the flow of energy in an ecosystem from **producers** to **consumers** and finally to **decomposers**.

---

### Components of a Food Chain
A food chain consists of **trophic levels**:

#### 1. **Producers (Trophic Level 1)**
- Also called **autotrophs**.
- Convert solar energy into chemical energy through **photosynthesis**.
- Examples: Green plants, algae, phytoplankton.

#### 2. **Primary Consumers (Trophic Level 2)**
- Also called **herbivores**.
- Consume producers for energy.
- Examples: Deer, grasshoppers, rabbits.

#### 3. **Secondary Consumers (Trophic Level 3)**
- Also called **carnivores** or **omnivores**.
- Feed on primary consumers.
- Examples: Frogs, snakes, birds.

#### 4. **Tertiary Consumers (Trophic Level 4)**
- Also called **top carnivores**.
- Feed on secondary consumers.
- Examples: Lions, eagles, tigers.

#### 5. **Decomposers (Last Trophic Level)**

- Common in nutrient recycling and decomposition.
- Example: Dead Leaves ‚Üí Earthworm ‚Üí Bird ‚Üí Hawk

---

### Flow of Energy in a Food Chain
Energy flows **unidirectionally** in a food chain, starting from producers and moving towards higher trophic levels. 

üìù **NOTE:** Only **10%** of energy is transferred to the next trophic level, while the rest is lost as heat. This principle is known as the **10% Law** proposed by Raymond Lindeman.

---

### Importance of Food Chains
- **Energy Transfer:** Facilitates the movement of energy through the ecosystem.
- **Nutrient Cycling:** Helps recycle nutrients through decomposers.
- **Ecological Balance:** Maintains population control and species interactions.

## Food Webs

### Definition of Food Web
A **food web** is a complex network of interconnected food chains within an ecosystem, showing how different organisms are related through multiple feeding relationships. Unlike a **food chain** which is linear, a food web provides a more realistic representation of energy flow and species interactions.

---

### Structure of a Food Web
A food web is made up of multiple **trophic levels**:

#### 1. **Producers (Trophic Level 1)**
- Form the base of the food web.
- Convert solar energy into chemical energy through **photosynthesis**.
- Examples: Plants, algae, phytoplankton.

#### 2. **Primary Consumers (Trophic Level 2)**
- Herbivores that feed on producers.
- Examples: Deer, grasshoppers, rabbits.

#### 3. **Secondary Consumers (Trophic Level 3)**
- Carnivores or omnivores that eat primary consumers.
- Examples: Frogs, snakes, small birds.

#### 4. **Tertiary Consumers (Trophic Level 4)**
- Top carnivores feeding on secondary consumers.

## Energy Flow in an Ecosystem

### Definition of Energy Flow
**Energy flow** in an ecosystem refers to the transfer of energy from one organism to another through the food chain and food web. It describes how energy moves through different trophic levels, starting from the **sun** as the primary source of energy.

---

### Laws Governing Energy Flow

#### 1. **First Law of Thermodynamics (Law of Energy Conservation)**
- Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.
- Example: Solar energy is converted into chemical energy by plants.

#### 2. **Second Law of Thermodynamics (Law of Energy Degradation)**
- During energy transfer, some energy is lost as heat.
- Only a small portion of energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next.

üìù **NOTE:** These laws explain why energy flow in an ecosystem is **unidirectional** and **inefficient**.

---

### Direction of Energy Flow
Energy flow in an ecosystem is **unidirectional** and moves from lower to higher trophic levels:

1. **Sun (Primary Energy Source)**  
   ‚Üì  
2. **Producers (Autotrophs)** ‚Äì Convert solar energy into chemical energy through **photosynthesis**.  
   ‚Üì  
3. **Primary Consumers (Herbivores)** ‚Äì Feed on producers.  
   ‚Üì  
4. **Secondary Consumers (Carnivores)** ‚Äì Feed on primary consumers.  
   ‚Üì  
5. **Tertiary Consumers (Top Predators)** ‚Äì Feed on secondary consumers.  
   ‚Üì  
6. **Decomposers (Saprotrophs)** ‚Äì Break down dead matter and recycle nutrients.

---

### Trophic Levels and Energy Transfer
A **trophic level** is a specific position in a food chain or web where organisms obtain their energy.

#### 1. **Trophic Level 1: Producers (Autotrophs)**
- Capture solar energy through photosynthesis.  
- Examples: Plants, algae, phytoplankton.

#### 2. **Trophic Level 2: Primary Consumers (Herbivores)**
- Consume producers for energy.  
- Examples: Grasshoppers, rabbits, deer.

#### 3. **Trophic Level 3: Secondary Consumers (Carnivores/Omnivores)**
- Feed on primary consumers.  
- Examples: Frogs, snakes.

#### 4. **Trophic Level 4: Tertiary Consumers (Top Carnivores)**
- Feed on secondary consumers.  
- Examples: Eagles, tigers.

#### 5. **Trophic Level 5: Decomposers**
- Break down organic matter and recycle nutrients.  
- Examples: Fungi, bacteria.

---

### Energy Transfer Efficiency: The 10% Law
The **10% Law**, proposed by **Raymond Lindeman**, states that only **10%** of the energy from one trophic level is transferred to the next, while the remaining **90%** is lost as heat.

**Example:**  
- Sunlight provides **1000 units** of energy to producers.  
- Producers retain **100 units** of energy.  
- Primary consumers retain **10 units** of energy.  
- Secondary consumers retain **1 unit** of energy.

üí° **TIP:** This energy loss limits the number of trophic levels in an ecosystem.

---

### Types of Energy Flow Models

#### 1. **Unidirectional Flow**
- Energy flows in one direction: **Sun ‚Üí Producers ‚Üí Consumers ‚Üí Decomposers.**
- Energy never flows backward.

#### 2. **Linear Flow (Food Chain Model)**
- Simple and direct energy flow through a food chain.

#### 3. **Complex Flow (Food Web Model)**
- Interconnected pathways with multiple food chains.

---

### Importance of Energy Flow in an Ecosystem
- **Maintains Ecosystem Functionality:** Ensures energy supply for all organisms.  
- **Supports Life Processes:** Provides energy for growth, reproduction, and survival.  
- **Controls Population Balance:** Energy availability regulates species populations.  
- **Recycles Nutrients:** Decomposers return nutrients to the soil for producers.  

üìù **NOTE:** Energy flow determines the productivity and sustainability of an ecosystem.

---

### Energy Flow Diagram Example (Grassland Ecosystem)
- **Sunlight** ‚Üí Grass (Producer) ‚Üí Grasshopper (Primary Consumer) ‚Üí Frog (Secondary Consumer) ‚Üí Snake (Tertiary Consumer) ‚Üí Decomposer (Fungi)

![](https://study.com/cimages/videopreview/4jaix9ao9e.jpg)

---

### Key Characteristics of Energy Flow
- **Unidirectional:** Flows only in one direction.  
- **Inefficient:** Energy loss occurs at each trophic level.  
- **Decreases at Higher Levels:** Limited energy reaches top consumers.  
- **Dependent on Solar Energy:** Primary energy source is the **sun**.  

---

‚ö†Ô∏è **CAUTION:** Disruption in energy flow (e.g., deforestation, pollution) can collapse entire ecosystems.
